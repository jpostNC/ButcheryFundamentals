00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.520
we're now going to actually vacuum seal some&nbsp;
meat in a plastic bag through the vacuum sealer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
before we do anything to do with the vacuum&nbsp;
sealing what we want to do is make sure that our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.937
station is completely sanitary clean, you can&nbsp;
see the hand sanitizer here paper towel clean hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:21.200
everything has to be immaculately clean before we&nbsp;
start because we want to ward off any bacteria,&nbsp;we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.240
don't want any bacteria growth on the meat as we're&nbsp;
doing this process so what I'm gonna do first is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.240
i'm just gonna get my gloves and in front of me&nbsp;
there i've got two pieces of ossobuco veal shin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.400
so I'm just going to put my gloves on to my&nbsp;
right hand side there i've got a plastic bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.480
these plastic bags are quite thick actually and&nbsp;
this is what we're going to use for the actual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.040
vacuum ceiling so I'm just pulling on my gloves&nbsp;
just to make make sure that I have absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.320
no bacteria anywhere what I'm going to be doing&nbsp;
first thing I want to do is just open up the bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.240
i'm just going to sort of fold the bag over and&nbsp;
then open that up what I'm going to do is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.080
use one of my hands to place the meat into the&nbsp;
bag while the other one will hold on to that bag

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.920
then I can pull this ready to go into the vacuum&nbsp;
sealer, the reason that we vacuum seal meat is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.760
ward off the bacteria it would actually allow&nbsp;
the meat to be fresher for a longer period of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.080
time this is something you're going to see in&nbsp;
the culinary industry you're going to see it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.280
in restaurants hotels you're also going to see a&nbsp;
lot in butcher shops and people will also do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.760
in supermarkets as well as they're going through&nbsp;
the process so again we want to make sure we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.360
as clean sanitary as possible putting it into the&nbsp;
bag making sure there's no bacteria in there, once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.814
that bag is sealed it would help ward off bacteria&nbsp;
from affecting the meat and making that meat rotten
