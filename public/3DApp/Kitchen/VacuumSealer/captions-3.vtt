00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.400
so i've now put on fresh gloves so there's no&nbsp;
bacteria on those and I'm in a position now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.520
i'm ready to vacuum seal the meat this is the&nbsp;
vacuum sealer now there's a lid that comes down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.520
there's two heating bars one here one inside the&nbsp;
machine as the lid comes down the oxygen will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.960
removed from the bag sucked out of the bag the&nbsp;
heat sealer will seal that so the plastic bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.720
is secure and very sealed also as I pull this&nbsp;
down there is a bar here this is a safety bar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.960
once it's gone through its process it's just&nbsp;
normally a minute and it's all sort of depending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.880
on how long you want to do it the heat the actual&nbsp;
size of the bag and the amount of meat you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.240
doing at times as well it's going to go for a&nbsp;
minute this one and once it's sealed, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.840
lid will actually pop up so this is designed so&nbsp;
that lid will open but it won't shoot up because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.360
it can be very dangerous if you some people looking at that and it shoots up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.600
it could hit somebody under the chin so it can be&nbsp;
quite dangerous so at this point what I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
to do is going to take the meat and I'm going to&nbsp;
put it into the vacuum machine and we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.040
to seal this, once the meat goes in you&nbsp;
always want to make sure that the plastic bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.040
is pushed over the heat sealing bar the heat&nbsp;
sealing bar when I bring the lid down will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.640
automatically start to work so it's going to heat&nbsp;
that up as the oxygen has pulled out of the bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
then it's going to seal it securely so first thing&nbsp;
i know just pull this down and again through here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
this is all on the timer this is going to go&nbsp;
for one minute with the pressure and with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.640
heat pull it down and then just flip over that&nbsp;
safety bar just hold it down and then you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:53.840
see as it sort of fills the bag with the air and&nbsp;
then it's going to remove everything out of it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.080
so the vacuum sealer has now run for that one&nbsp;
minute so I'm just going to open it up remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.440
that safety bar the lid will come up and then&nbsp;
this is what it looks like we've got that vacuum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.120
sealed product in the butcher shop, we&nbsp;
are able to prevent harmful bacteria growth with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.640
five different steps oxygen, time, temperature, PH&nbsp;
level and moisture by vacuum sealing this meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.240
we have actually got through those critical points&nbsp;
we have removed the oxygen we've actually for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.000
temperature we can make sure that this is in the&nbsp;
fridge correct staying cold and also the moisture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.240
we've removed the moisture from that too so that&nbsp;
is helping to prevent any harmful bacterial growth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.720
harmful bacterias that grow in oxygen are&nbsp;
called aerobic bacterias so again by vacuum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.720
sealing that we're removing that, there is another&nbsp;
type of bacteria called anaerobic and that grows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.600
with the absence of oxygen and&nbsp;
an example of that would be botulism
