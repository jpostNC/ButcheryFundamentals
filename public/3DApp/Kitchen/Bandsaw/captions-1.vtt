00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.560
so this is a bandsaw this is used for cutting bone&nbsp;
you never cut meat on a bandsaw this is used in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.680
lot of retail butchery shops not particularly&nbsp;
do you see a great deal within the culinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.080
industry but you will see it sometimes it&nbsp;
was very classical back in the day when i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.320
first started in the industry we'd actually cut&nbsp;
the bones of the veal stock on a bandsaw so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840
get more of the gelatine out and get a more&nbsp;
gelatinous beef stock what you should always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.880
do with any machinery is make sure that it is&nbsp;
unplugged before you start it before you clean it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:41.383
before you start doing any operations of any&nbsp;
sort so right now I'm just going to plug this in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.240
once the bandsaw is plugged in&nbsp;
same with all of the electrical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.280
equipment that we're going to be using make sure&nbsp;
that it is turned off so you always have a red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.400
and a green button the red button is for&nbsp;
stop the green is for go normally the red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.033
button protrudes so you can hit it very&nbsp;
quickly if you need to stop it quickly

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.720
so you can see there that the bandsaw starts&nbsp;
to turn there's a motor inside the bandsaw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.800
so that blade is spinning around very very&nbsp;
quickly what we're going to be doing today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.720
is cutting a veal shin what&nbsp;
you never do is actually cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.920
meat on a bandsaw what you want to do is&nbsp;
just actually cut the bone so here is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.800
veal shin chin or shank and we've already cut&nbsp;
through the meat so we can see the bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.760
as we put it onto the bandsaw just to make sure&nbsp;
that it's going through cleanly otherwise the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.920
actual blade would tear the actual meat what i'm&nbsp;
always going to do is wear a mesh vest like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.480
something very important if perhaps that blade&nbsp;
did break on me and it came towards me I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.440
be very safe there it's protecting me and I'm also&nbsp;
going to wear safety goggles too so if you goggles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.960
their design you might get bone fragment, you don't want anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.800
that might even you know sort of go towards&nbsp;
your eyes you want to make sure you're well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.840
protected so I'm going to put on safety goggles&nbsp;
and now I'm just going to turn on the bandsaw

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.247
and now I'm just going to cut through the bone

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.040
just to let that come to a complete stop so&nbsp;
there we can see we have actually cut here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.920
an ossobuco the sort of white bone fragment around&nbsp;
also so before you ever cook something like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
what you're going to do is get a scraper and you&nbsp;
scrape off all of the bone fragments as well and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.000
you can see a very clean cut through the bone&nbsp;
here and it's actually so sharp you can actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.080
see the bone marrow in the bone as well so again&nbsp;
this will be a classic ossobuco beef or veal shin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.653
and that's what we would traditionally&nbsp;
use the bandsaw for cutting with
