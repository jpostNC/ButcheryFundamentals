00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.240
it's very important when you're&nbsp;
putting the grinder together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.920
you make sure that the blade is facing&nbsp;
outwards in the correct manner if we put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.920
the blade in incorrect with the actual&nbsp;
blades facing in towards the machine

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:29.840
that can have very bad consequences&nbsp;
for when we start to grind

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.360
with the blade facing the wrong&nbsp;
way the meat will not come through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.600
correctly this is what we refer to the&nbsp;
smearing and this is because the blade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.979
is not facing the correct&nbsp;
way in the actual unit itself
