00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.320
when we're grinding meat through the grinder i&nbsp;
want to make sure that everything is icy cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.600
i'm going to make sure that the meat has&nbsp;
been dried normally for a classic force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.760
meat we're going to have 20% fat 80% meat, we&nbsp;
need to make sure everything is over ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.680
stainless steel bowls everything is completely&nbsp;
cold as cold as we possibly can get it when we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.480
actually doing this it's called an emulsification&nbsp;
we're grinding the meat and the fat together if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.320
the fat gets too warm it will start to smear&nbsp;
and will not get the correct emulsification&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
and again the reason why everything we got&nbsp;
here is coming out of the freezer or it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.240
been in an ice bath and it is absolutely as cold&nbsp;
as possible first I want to do is just turn it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.240
green for go red for stop and then&nbsp;
i want to put the meat into the grinder

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.600
then with my hand and the meat stuffer i&nbsp;
want to start pushing the meat through to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.120
start the grinding process as you can see&nbsp;
as it's coming through there it is grinding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.440
and you've got a mixture of the meat and of the&nbsp;
fat don't try and force too much meat through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.040
too quickly you just want to drop it down into&nbsp;
the chamber and then just push it through into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.000
the bowl the stainless steel&nbsp;
bowl that is on the ice itself

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.760
so as you can see the meat is coming out&nbsp;
of the grinder plate if I clean that away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.160
you can see as the
 the meat as I'm going&nbsp;
to put a little bit more through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.400
and this would be if we were doing a double&nbsp;
ground application again pushing it through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.280
and you can see as the meat is&nbsp;
coming there on the double ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.200
it is emulsifying and grinding the fat even&nbsp;
further into the meat to create the force meat
