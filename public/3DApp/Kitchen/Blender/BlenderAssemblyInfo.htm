<p><b><span class="bblue">Chamber head:</span></b> L shaped tubular  part of meat grinder that holds the auger.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Auger:</span></b> Part of a meat grinder that resembles a drill bit, it pushes meat towards the grinder blade and plate.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Grinder Blade:</span></b> a  + (cross) shaped metal cutter with 4 sides, one of each of the 4 sides is sharpened into a blade. The sharpened side presses up against the grinder plate. When the auger spins it pushes the meat against the grinder plate and the grinder blade cuts it and forces it through the plate and the end result is  ground meat. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Food pan:</span></b> top part of meat grinder that holds the meat before it is ground.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Meat Pusher:</span></b> Tool used to push meat into the meat grinder, resembles a cylinder.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Grinder plate:</span></b> a circular metal plate with holes used in a meat grinder- the size of the holes determines the size of the ground meat that will be pushed through the plate.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Retaining ring:</span></b> Holds the grinder plate and grinder blade in place on the chamber head.   </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Body of grinder:</span></b> the engine that operates the parts of a meat grinder. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Schmear:</span></b> (smear) an undesirable result of meat and fat being ground together where the fat melts and smears. Usually occurs if a grinder is not assembled correctly or if it gets stuck with bone fragments. </p>

<p><b>Instructions for Meat Grinder  Assembly:</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure all parts are clean, sanitized and dried. Make sure equipment is unplugged. Chill all grinder parts except for the body of the grinder. </li>
    <li>Attach chamber head to the body of the grinder and screw it in place</li>
    <li>Insert the auger (drill shaped part that moves meat forward towards the blade)</li>
    <li>Attach the blade then the platel. Blade proper assembly - make sure the flat sharpened side is pressed against  the plate, facing away from the body if assembled improperly it will cause schmearing. If schmearing occurs, stop and unplug the machine. Disassemble and then reassemble correctly. </li>
    <li>Properly align the semi circle on the plate with the dimple of the grinder chamber.</li>
    <li>Tighten all together at about 80 % tightness using the retaining ring. (if the blade is too tightly screwed to the plate it could dull the blades. (When meat starts to come through the plate,  tighten the remaining 20% snugly.) </li>
    <li>Attach the food pan, add chilled meat to the pan.  </li>
    <li>Have the meat pusher close to start pushing the meat down.  </li>
    <li>use the green button to start the machine and red button to turn it off</li>
    <li>slowly start pushing the meat into the chamber head using the meat pusher- do not overload it. The meat should come out uniformly.</li>
    <li>When all of the meat has been ground and the machine turned off,  unplug machine before taking it apart for cleaning</li>
  </ol>
