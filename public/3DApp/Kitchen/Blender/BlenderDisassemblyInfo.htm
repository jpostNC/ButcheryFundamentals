  <p><b><span class="bblue">Chamber head:</span></b> L shaped tubular  part of meat grinder that holds the auger. 
  </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Auger:</span></b> Part of a meat grinder that resembles a drill bit, it pushes meat towards the grinder blade and plate.  </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Grinder Blade:</span></b> a  + (cross) shaped metal cutter with 4 sides, one of each of the 4 sides is sharpened into a blade. The sharpened side presses up against the grinder plate. When the auger spins it pushes the meat against the grinder plate and the grinder blade cuts it and forces it through the plate and the end result is  ground meat. </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Food pan:</span></b> top part of meat grinder that holds the meat before it is ground.  </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Meat Pusher:</span></b> Tool used to push meat into the meat grinder, resembles a cylinder.  </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Grinder plate:</span></b> a circular metal plate with holes used in a meat grinder- the size of the holes determines the size of the ground meat that will be pushed through the plate.  </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Retaining ring:</span></b> Holds the grinder plate and grinder blade in place on the chamber head.   </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Body of grinder:</span></b> the engine that operates the parts of a meat grinder. </p>
  <p><b><span class="bblue">Schmear:</span></b> (smear) an undesirable result of meat and fat being ground together where the fat melts and smears. Usually occurs if a grinder is not assembled correctly or if it gets stuck with bone fragments. </p>
