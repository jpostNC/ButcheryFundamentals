00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.520
here we have all of the parts for the grinder&nbsp;
this is referred to as the chamber head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.800
the auger and the blade these are the grinder plates&nbsp;
which can be at different sizes depending on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:24.080
the application this is the retaining ring the&nbsp;
food pan and this is the meat pusher what is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.120
important about this machine is&nbsp;
that it gets set up correctly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.640
if it's not set up correctly it will not work&nbsp;
properly so it's very very important that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.320
is done in the process and we have laid it out&nbsp;
here in the process that I will put it directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.400
into the mechanical area here this is the&nbsp;
engine this is what will start the grinder, prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.920
to putting everything together on the&nbsp;
grinder make sure that it is always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.000
unplugged, now we're going to get the chamber head&nbsp;
and attach that to the body of the grinder it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.720
will move a little bit the best way is to pull it&nbsp;
towards you as you then begin to tighten that up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.280
once it's tight you don't want any movement in it&nbsp;
make sure that is completely tight in there next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.880
we're going to put the auger in there the auger as&nbsp;
we turn it on spins round that is pushing the meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.560
forward into the blades this just slides into the&nbsp;
chamber you just want to twist it around slightly

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.120
when the blade is put into the grinder and the&nbsp;
plate attaches the actual blade is spinning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.240
round cutting the meat as it's pushed&nbsp;
through and it is coming out of the plate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.720
if we have the blade the wrong way around&nbsp;
and the blades are facing towards the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.200
as it spins it will not cut and that will stop the&nbsp;
meat from coming through and that will create the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:08.080
smear that we don't want so again blade going&nbsp;
in with the blades facing outwards the plate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.320
where there's a little semi-circle cut away in the&nbsp;
plate there's a small dimple they need to attach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.280
together tighten it about 80 percent of the way&nbsp;
when the meat is coming through then you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.760
fully tighten it if it's too tight to begin with&nbsp;
the blade can stick against the plate somewhat

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680
now you can attach the food pan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.320
you have the meat pusher here so as the meat&nbsp;
is in the food pan you're pushing it through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.840
into the chamber the ground meat will come out&nbsp;
to start the grinder press the green button

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.960
to stop it press the red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.160
always when you're cleaning it make&nbsp;
sure that you have unplugged the machine
