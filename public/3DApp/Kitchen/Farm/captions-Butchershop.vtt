00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
Hey my name is Peter Sanagan I own Sanagan's meat&nbsp;
locker a couple butcher shops in Toronto focusing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:14.720
on all Ontario meats and poultry so I came to&nbsp;
this business as a as a chef originally so it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.040
really important to me to be able to provide cuts&nbsp;
that I would have used in restaurants before so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.960
not just trimmed appropriately but also making&nbsp;
sure that you know it's going to look nice and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.040
most importantly tastes really nice&nbsp;
on the plate right so the freshness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.680
is really important it's also important to me&nbsp;
to to support local family farms in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.200
Ontario that's a big piece of me, wherever&nbsp;
you are I think it's really important to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.360
supporting the farmers around you so&nbsp;
I've developed relationships over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.200
years with a variety, a network really,&nbsp;
of great farmers who contribute to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.240
um to really what we do here and what we sell&nbsp;
and from from what I I've been doing this for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.840
12 years now and you really notice a really&nbsp;
positive reaction from our clientele from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.960
being in the store having a great experience&nbsp;
with our service team to having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.200
their dinner at the end of the night and then letting us know about, it's a really um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.920
I mean you talk about farm to table&nbsp;
but it's a really fantastic positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
seamless experience and as a butcher I feel that's a really important thing like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.120
at the end of the day a lot of people still&nbsp;
have meat as the centerpiece of their meals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.560
and it's important to me to make sure you know&nbsp;
where your meat is coming from it's cut well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.560
it's cooked well and it eats well and it you know&nbsp;
tastes fantastic so that's really big that that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.560
kind of my my big philosophy with with butchery&nbsp;
so as a chef I was used to having local farmers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.600
bring in a lot of my protein a lot of proteins&nbsp;
in the into the the restaurants and break them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.880
down and and serving them in the restaurants&nbsp;
was was fantastic when I opened the butcher shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.520
the main idea was how can we get a lot of these&nbsp;
farmers and their products to to the public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
and surprisingly for a city as big as&nbsp;
Toronto there wasn't as many shops doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.120
at the time this is back in 2009 so you know i&nbsp;
already had a few friends that were doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.400
like farmers that were raising animals so through&nbsp;
them I just kind of met more and more and more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.520
you know at the end of the day it's not&nbsp;
that hard to go and talk to farmers find out how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880
they're raising them or where they're doing it,
what they're feeding them, what breeds they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.120
raising, all those different questions can&nbsp;
be answered and then that way for myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.560
and my my team we can share that information to&nbsp;
the customers who many of them want to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.040
that stuff, so you know all my stuff comes&nbsp;
from like I mentioned family farms and what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.840
I mean by that is like the people who are actually&nbsp;
it's not just some like middle people that don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.120
know where&nbsp;
the animals are from or anything like that so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.760
that's an important piece of the puzzle to me um&nbsp;
so what advice I give like someone wanting to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.920
in the industry whether as a cook or as a butcher&nbsp;
or any kind of food related thing is number one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.760
don't forget your passion for it that's a&nbsp;
big thing if you have passion for what you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.960
it will help drive you through thick and thin and&nbsp;
there's a lot of thick there's a lot of challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:45.200
in the world of of food both retail and&nbsp;
hospitality but remember your passion for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.680
then number two just just getting into&nbsp;
the habit of, I know this sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.280
maybe old school or whatnot but listen, ask&nbsp;
the right questions, pay attention and and do what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.600
you're directed to do and that kind of head down&nbsp;
work mentality will will get you really far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.920
there's a lot of like there's a lot of places&nbsp;
where if you have the the I mean you can kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.840
of wrap it up in this like phrase of work ethic if&nbsp;
you have a strong work ethic but what that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.040
to some people is different than others all&nbsp;
I think is if we have someone new coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.840
in here and they want to learn how to butcher you&nbsp;
come in you'll get direction, follow the direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.720
and work on your discipline and your&nbsp;
speed and your efficiency and your organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.600
and then you wake up the next day you do it again&nbsp;
you do the next day next week next month and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.720
eventually after a few years it'll be muscle&nbsp;
memory it'll be yeah a lot of things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.120
come second nature which allows you to then make&nbsp;
the next step and you keep going and keep going
