<p><b>Mechanically Tenderized Food Safety Concern</b></p>
<p>
    It is important to note that “In general, the internal temperature of a steak or other solid cut of beef is not a significant concern given that any harmful bacteria that may be present would normally be on the surface of the meat and would be inactivated during cooking. However, when steaks and beef cuts are mechanically tenderized, there is a potential for bacteria to be transferred from the surface to the centre of the meat. Therefore, there may be an increased risk to consumers from MTB.”
