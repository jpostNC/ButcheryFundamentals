00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.080
i'm going to show you two ways of tenderizing&nbsp;
meat this is the meat mallet that is one way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.320
we're going to take a a tough cut of&nbsp;
meat and we're going to tap that meat out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
using this breaks down the muscle group the fiber&nbsp;
and that tenderizes the meat normally we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.080
to do that with with cuts of meat that we're&nbsp;
going to use for a schnitzel for a scallopini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.520
those type of cuts could be beef pork can also be&nbsp;
chicken this is what we refer to as a mechanical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.800
meat tenderizer also known as a delicator&nbsp;
in the delicator there's some blades&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.040
that spin around very very quickly we drop the&nbsp;
meat through the top it comes through these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.880
blades and the blades very very quickly slice&nbsp;
the meat and the meat will then fall under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.160
bottom of this tenderized so I'm just going to run&nbsp;
through the process of how we put this together

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.280
so it breaks apart like this and then guiding arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.360
attach like so across the top of the&nbsp;
blades there's two guiding arms normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.520
there's letters on here so you've got&nbsp;
A &amp; B, B &amp; A and those clip together

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.840
and then these will then drop&nbsp;
into the delicator itself

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.840
there we go, the locking mechanism works with the guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.960
the actual delicator is designed not to turn&nbsp;
on unless this guard is actually covering all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.200
of the blades so it's safe obviously we never&nbsp;
trust that and we will never turn anything on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.520
or prepare anything, unless it has been unplugged very very important we always have everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.640
unplugged as we were putting things together or&nbsp;
taking them apart I'm now going to plug this in

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.880
so the delicator will start spinning the switch&nbsp;
is underneath there's a dead switch here as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.680
refer to if that is turned off it will not&nbsp;
turn on at all so there's a switch here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920
it has to be turned on the light will then&nbsp;
come on and then I can turn the delicator on

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.400
so at this point now those blades are&nbsp;
spinning around we'll drop a piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.200
meat into here it'll cut through those&nbsp;
blades and tenderize that piece of meat
