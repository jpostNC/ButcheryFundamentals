00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.960
so here I have a piece that is cut&nbsp;
from the veal inside round from the leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
a little bit of a tougher piece this is perfect&nbsp;
to use in the delicate so what I want to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.640
turn the delicate on and I'm just going to&nbsp;
drop that piece of meat through the delicator

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.200
once it's gone through the delicator you can see&nbsp;
the slices from the blades they've perforated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.360
the meat to tenderize it obviously now that&nbsp;
we've opened up this meat there is chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.920
a bacteria growth within that because it's&nbsp;
open so you don't want to hold this for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.200
long time you want to process this as quickly as&nbsp;
possible, another application to tenderize meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.280
is by using a meat mallet that's that one&nbsp;
here obviously you could use one that is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.160
wooden handle one a little bit more heavier this&nbsp;
one is perfect for this application again got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.120
a little bit of the veal inside round i'm&nbsp;
just going to put this into a plastic bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.960
when you're tenderizing the meat you want&nbsp;
to make sure that the meat has got enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.200
room to move it's going to spread because&nbsp;
we need to get this thin if you've got too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.400
many pieces together you won't be able to do the&nbsp;
application correctly I'm going to start off using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.160
what we refer to as the dimple end of the meat&nbsp;
mallet so you're going to start tapping this out

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.840
you can also flip it over and do the other side

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.680
once i've got that application&nbsp;
done I'm going to use the flat side

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.840
this will allow me to create shape

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.560
and to flatten the veal

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.440
there is the piece that was put through the&nbsp;
delicator and here is the piece that we did using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.720
the traditional meat mallets so again&nbsp;
that is a way of tenderizing cuts of meat
