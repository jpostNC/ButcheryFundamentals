00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
when taking apart to clean the meat&nbsp;
slicer the first thing you have to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.440
is that the dial is to zero and the&nbsp;
blade is not showing then make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.520
you disconnect it from the electrical source by&nbsp;
unplugging it now we want to remove the food tray

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.360
unscrewing

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.840
the bolt pulling that away

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.080
that removes the food tray

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.840
next we want to remove the plate

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.640
unscrewing the spindle

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200
removing the plate

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.200
there is a guard that is&nbsp;
surrounding the blade for safety

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.960
one of the safety features of this model of vocal&nbsp;
slicer is once all of the mechanical parts are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.360
removed you cannot open the actual dial so&nbsp;
that the blade is always safe and covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080
once everything is clean and sanitized you&nbsp;
then want to put the slicer back together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.400
you take the plate it's a small little&nbsp;
area you can hold that from, slide that in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.200
make sure that is very very tight and that plate&nbsp;
is secured against the blade be careful when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.120
handling the food tray as this can come down very&nbsp;
quickly make sure your hands are away from this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.280
slide it back onto the nut and then tighten it

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.520
make sure it is fully tightened&nbsp;
so the food tray is secured
