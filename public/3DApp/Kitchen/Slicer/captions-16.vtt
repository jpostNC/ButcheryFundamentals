00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.640
so this is the meat slicing machine the&nbsp;
on off button is down here there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.280
zero which means it's turned off and then&nbsp;
there's a one which means it is turned on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.920
always ensure that the blade is&nbsp;
at zero before turning the machine on

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.680
this dial will give you the thickness of the&nbsp;
meat or the cheese that you will be slicing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.080
that works so you can get whatever thickness&nbsp;
you desire always make sure again it's at zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.560
so it is closed before you start operating&nbsp;
the machine once you've placed meat or cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.600
into the food tray you're going to do so by&nbsp;
placing it down against the guide and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.200
where these dimple ends are pushing down quite&nbsp;
firmly to secure the meat or the cheese that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.360
you are slicing, when slicing you can put your left&nbsp;
hand on the top right hand to guide whatever it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.440
that you are slicing through the machine you&nbsp;
can also use just your right hand to push the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.000
meat through too what you should never do&nbsp;
is have the guard open and push the meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.840
through with your hand here that is very very&nbsp;
dangerous and can lead to a very nasty accident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.000
so for the thickness I'm going to do this i'm&nbsp;
going to put it through with slicing some double&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.880
smoked bacon I'm just going to start the setting&nbsp;
off at about two / one and a half I'm going to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.160
one and a half I'm going to&nbsp;
turn the machine on and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.160
when we're right hand is on top and I'm just&nbsp;
going to glide the meat through you can gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.320
each slice with your hand your hand has&nbsp;
to stay a long way away from the blade

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880
if I would like this meat a little thicker

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.080
then I can adjust the dial so I can get a&nbsp;
thicker piece of sliced bacon if I wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.840
also if I wanted it thinner I can adjust the&nbsp;
dial so that it is a thinner slice as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.880
so traditionally we're going to use this in&nbsp;
the industry for slicing deli meats roast meats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.240
and cheeses, it can also be used for hot meats

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.360
and always turn it off and then before you put&nbsp;
your hands anywhere near what you've sliced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.600
and then turn the dial to a zero
