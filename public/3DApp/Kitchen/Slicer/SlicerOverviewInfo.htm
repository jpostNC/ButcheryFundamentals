<p><b><span class="bblue">Dial:</span></b> Indicator on slicer used to determine thickness of the slice. The smaller the number the thinner the slice.  </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Food Tray (Slicer):</span></b> part on deli slicer used to hold the product being sliced.   </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Guard:</span></b> Protective plate on deli slicer to protect hand from blade </p>

<p><b>Instructions for Using Slicer.</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure the machine is turned off and the dial is adjusted to 0 so there is no exposed blade. </li>
    <li>Slide the guard up and place the food product on the food tray and press the guard onto the product.</li>
    <li>Turn dial to desired thickness setting</li>
    <li>Turn machine on</li>
    <li>Push meat onto the slicer blade by using guard handles provided.</li>
    <li>NEVER OPERATE A SLICER WITHOUT USING THE GUARD. PEOPLE LOSE FINGERS AND GET HORRIBLE CUTS BY DOING THIS. </li>
    <li>Slice your product. </li>
    <li>When you have completed the slicing, turn the machine off and unplug it before washing it. </li>
