00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.960
those are the variations of boning&nbsp;
knives this is another example of one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.600
you can see the differential there sort of more of&nbsp;
a rounded blade to it a little bit of a tip there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.600
this one is great if you've actually got to use&nbsp;
the dagger cut with butchery and you just need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.200
apply an awful lot of pressure to something if&nbsp;
you're coming right up against the bone before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.080
you're doing muscle removal and this tip is very&nbsp;
good also if you're removing skin say from a pork&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.920
leg you want to get underneath and this helps&nbsp;
you sort of arc round and cut through that too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.880
other knives you're also going to use in butchery&nbsp;
these ones are called scimitars so you get a large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.760
one like this this one application will be if&nbsp;
you're cutting something like a striploin steak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.440
maybe you're also doing a rib eye&nbsp;
steak something that you can get a nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.040
long roll onto that piece of meat so it's a very&nbsp;
very long slice that's called a simmeter and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.640
this is of just a smaller variation of that as&nbsp;
well it just allows you to sort of cut through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.080
or pull back if you're doing dice anything like&nbsp;
that this also is very good if you need to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.680
skin i'll get underneath that as well so those&nbsp;
two there those are what we refer to as scimitar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
this is a japanese boning knife referred to as&nbsp;
a honesuki a little bit of difference between a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.480
european style knife and a japanese knife is&nbsp;
the actual bevel so if I look at this boning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.480
knife here the bevel is identical all the way&nbsp;
through the blade the japanese burning knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.520
is slightly different where we have eighty&nbsp;
percent of the blade and then twenty percent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.680
of the blade so this sharpens very differently&nbsp;
very very stiff very very firm knife and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.720
that is a japanese style boning knife, something&nbsp;
else that you might see as well in a butcher shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.200
is a cleaver so this can be used as well maybe&nbsp;
you need to take the chine bone off a pork rack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.320
you can hold that and you can come down the bone&nbsp;
and that is designed it's very sharp as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.040
and it's very heavy it's designed to cut&nbsp;
through bone so if you don't have a bandsaw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.920
that's the application that you're going to&nbsp;
use again that is referred to as a cleaver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.920
these are referred to as meat mallets so it's&nbsp;
got a smaller one here that is completely metal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.880
and a wooden handled one here this one's a little&nbsp;
heavier actually depending on the application if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.080
you were making say a schnitzel and you had to&nbsp;
pound down the meat obviously to make it thin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.240
and that will also tenderize the meat somewhat as&nbsp;
well so there's two ends on this one we refer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.640
these as dimple ends there's a very big one there&nbsp;
that's what you would use actually tenderize down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.400
and then this one would use to flatten&nbsp;
it slightly and then this side too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.240
you can tap down and that will flatten the meat&nbsp;
again same process for this one not quite as big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.280
but again you've got the dimple end that you would&nbsp;
begin to use first tapping the meat out and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.880
this is the flat side you would just bang through&nbsp;
and that would flatten the meat also so those are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.800
the two types of meat mallets that you will see&nbsp;
traditionally in the industry and also at college
