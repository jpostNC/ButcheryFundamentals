00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.720
this piece of equipment is called the butcher's hook&nbsp;
sits in your hand and your fist right between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.920
the middle of your hand between the fingers little&nbsp;
point on it this is designed to go into big pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.600
of muscle you can pull that muscle away from&nbsp;
yourself so it's also assisting in the safety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.200
as you are releasing big muscles you're pulling&nbsp;
the meat away as you're using your knife to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.320
say very very close to the bone and then you're&nbsp;
pulling that actual big piece of muscle away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.360
can also be used if you're doing something such&nbsp;
as an "Aitch" bone where you can actually hook it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.280
the "Aitch" bone pull away so that it is allowing you&nbsp;
with pressure just to release the actual bone from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
the flesh a little bit easier, other equipment&nbsp;
you're going to see also in the butcher shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
is butcher's twine this is what we're going to&nbsp;
use for tying roasts something along those lines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.680
and that's what it looks like it's always&nbsp;
called a roll and that is butcher's twine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.800
this is a barding or a larding needle what we will&nbsp;
do with this is apply some fat into this push the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.840
hook end through here all the way through and as&nbsp;
it squeezes through it would leave a piece of fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.120
and a very lean piece of meat that might need&nbsp;
roasting an example of this could quite easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.000
be a whole turkey where you perhaps would like to&nbsp;
put a little bit of fat into the breast because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.280
it's going to cook a little bit quicker than&nbsp;
the legs so you're applying fat to moisturize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.240
the meat, other equipment that you're going&nbsp;
to see in the butcher shop this is what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.160
refer to as the butcher saw or a bone saw so&nbsp;
this is used to actually saw through the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.920
again if you don't have a bandsaw this is what&nbsp;
you would be using for that and this is a mesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.800
chain mail glove so you can see it's metal this&nbsp;
is used a lot in industrial meat packaging plants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.680
it's normally put on the non cutting hand&nbsp;
so when you're doing lots of meat at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.160
you will if you do cut yourself you will your&nbsp;
blade the point might still go through that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.240
chain mail but it will stop you having&nbsp;
a really really nasty cut and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.560
that is used for safety that is a chain&nbsp;
mail butcher's glove, now we're moving into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.520
fish and seafood equipment so this one this is a&nbsp;
japanese global this is for fish filleting very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.200
very flexible so when you're coming through the&nbsp;
bones to say a flat fish it allows you to glide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.760
that knife through the flesh across the top of the&nbsp;
bones, now we're moving into bone removal of fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.240
these are sort of a german style tweezers that&nbsp;
you can use to say pull the bones out of the side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.960
of salmon these are japanese style tweezers and&nbsp;
these ones here these are just a very very small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.480
tweezer we find these are great for removing&nbsp;
the bones from oily fish such as trout fillet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.680
this is a scaler so for big fish if they're coming&nbsp;
in you've still got the scales on you can actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.000
run this down the scales and it will remove the&nbsp;
scales without tearing the skin and then this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
an oyster shucker, the oyster shucker got a little bit&nbsp;
of a lip angle so when you come into the oyster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.840
it allows you to pop the shell up and again&nbsp;
all of this equipment are things that you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.720
see in the industry, not all of it is necessary for&nbsp;
you to have as you go through your time at college
