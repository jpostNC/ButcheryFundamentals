<p><b><span class="bblue">Sharpening stone:</span></b> Stones are used to sharpen knives, they can be made from natural stone, diamonds or composite stones. They can be used with water or with oil to lubricate the stone. Oil should never be used on natural stones. Stones are defined by their grit measure. The higher the grit, the finer the stone. 300 grit is used to fix blades or start a new edge. 1000 grit is a common all purpose grit for beginners. </p>
