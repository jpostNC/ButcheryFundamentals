00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.800
also with my steel in my left hand I can then&nbsp;
sharpen my knives I'm honing them on this steel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.720
so the steel has some grit there's different types of steels this one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.720
sort of like a medium grip for me and that's&nbsp;
actually perfect for the type of knives that i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.800
sharpening if I was doing something like a&nbsp;
japanese knife I might want to put that onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.440
something like a clay stone as opposed to using&nbsp;
a steel like this which could actually damage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.640
the knife so when I'm sharpening what I tend to do&nbsp;
is I make sure that my thumb is directly under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.440
hilt of this where the handle is so if I'm coming&nbsp;
down I'm not going to hit myself I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.080
make sure my hand it's sort of wrapped around the&nbsp;
actual handle there and I keep it on an angle so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.920
it's coming up towards the right hand side to sort of&nbsp;
keep the steel away from me too, if I'm sharpening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.600
my french knife what I want to do is I tend to put&nbsp;
my thumb directly on the top of that knife that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.520
gives me the ability to create a rolling action&nbsp;
so I'm going to come down with a rolling action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.960
one side and then the other you want to be doing&nbsp;
this on a on average we call it a 14 degree angle

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.280
once you get competent you can do it a&nbsp;
little bit quicker but in the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.440
there is no rush to do it quickly at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.920
and I'm rolling my wrist making sure that the tip of&nbsp;
that knife is not going down towards my left hand

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.760
another methodology you can use is just put your&nbsp;
steel down onto your board put the heel of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.880
knife against the steel you can sort of see the&nbsp;
angle that I'm coming out there at 14 degrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:51.440
and then draw the knife across the steel and&nbsp;
again it does not need to be quick but you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.280
to make sure you're coming from the heel of the&nbsp;
knife all the way through to the tip of the knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.680
same application if I'm using the boning knife i&nbsp;
like to keep my thumb just across the top of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.320
blade across the top of the knife so not the blade&nbsp;
itself so you won't get a sort of a rolling action

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.240
and again I'm going from the heel&nbsp;
of my knife to the tip of my knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.560
and I'm making sure I'm getting every single&nbsp;
part of that across the steel and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
you don't want to be coming down too quickly&nbsp;
towards your hand want to be nice and safe

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.973
with the sharpening of your knives
