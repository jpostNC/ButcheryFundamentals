00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.120
so once i've got the cutting board set up secured&nbsp;
firmly, what I'm going to do is then just bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.880
out 3 of the most important knives that you're&nbsp;
going to use in your classes at school and also in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.320
the industry also and in meat cutting what I want&nbsp;
to do first is actually sanitize those as well so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.200
the first piece of equipment I'm sanitizing&nbsp;
here is my honing steel so that's something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.480
i'm going to use just to make sure that&nbsp;
i'm keeping an edge on my knives at all times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.800
next one is what we refer to&nbsp;
as the classical french knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.680
okay for me personally I like it it's a 10&nbsp;
inch or 12 inch blade but it's got a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.840
bit of a hilt there so if I am chopping I can&nbsp;
apply pressure from the heel of that knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.560
it's very secure and safe so again what i&nbsp;
want to do just sanitize that a little bit

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.360
with the sanitizer spray and again making sure&nbsp;
that everything is clean tidy before I process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.840
and then the final knife will be my boning knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.520
so there's many different types of&nbsp;
boning knives this is the one that I prefer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.080
the majority of the knife cuts that I'm going&nbsp;
to do and this is sort of a stiff bladed one you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.280
can get something a little bit more flexible this&nbsp;
one is a bit more of a stiff bladed knife this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.960
what the setup should look like I'm right-handed&nbsp;
so my steel is always to my left so I can pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
that up and just start sharpening my knives and&nbsp;
i always have my french knife and my bone knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.160
to my right hand side with the blades facing away&nbsp;
what I don't want is the blade facing towards me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.880
i can have an accident if I go to reach for that&nbsp;
knife in that way and also it's quite awkward to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.200
sort of pick the knife up there that way for speed&nbsp;
so when I'm doing anything I want to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.400
pick up this knife I can put it back down if i'm&nbsp;
butchering then I can put it back down that way too
