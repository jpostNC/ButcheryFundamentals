00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.120
Hello my name is stuart betterage I'm a chef&nbsp;
instructor at george brown college and what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.560
going to do now is sort of show you how to set up&nbsp;
your station as you come into your classes and go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.320
through sort of the basic knives and equipment&nbsp;
that you'll require first thing we always want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.360
to do is sanitize that station down so got the&nbsp;
sanitizer here spray that down get some paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.040
towel and you really want to vigorously give&nbsp;
us a good wipe down this will kill any bacteria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.640
that might be on there so before we even start&nbsp;
getting ready to cut any type of preparation we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.280
starting with a clean and sanitized workstation&nbsp;
just going to get a little mat this is a plastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.280
mat sometimes referred to as bar matting as&nbsp;
well, actually you might see it in the industry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.040
you can put glasses on there, so it is not slipping&nbsp;
and then I'm going to get my cutting board&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.400
and I put my cutting board I always want to check&nbsp;
that it's flat sometimes as the cutting boards get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.040
older they sort of bevel a little bit as well so&nbsp;
you want to make sure you've got the flattest side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.080
that will go onto that mat and this stops any&nbsp;
type of movement a lot of times in the industry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.840
or even at college you're not going to be on&nbsp;
a wooden board you'll actually be on stainless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.800
steel that stainless steel can make it slip&nbsp;
so you want to make sure that it is very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.040
secure, also in an industry what you will see&nbsp;
is different color cutting boards these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.560
all used for different applications brown&nbsp;
is used for cooked meat, red this one here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.000
is used for raw meat, blue raw raw fish and&nbsp;
seafood, green vegetable and fruit preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
yellow is for raw poultry and you can&nbsp;
also get the white one which we got here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.200
is used for bakery and dairy product these&nbsp;
will be used to avoid cross-contamination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.720
so you will never use a red board like this&nbsp;
for any other application apart from raw meats
