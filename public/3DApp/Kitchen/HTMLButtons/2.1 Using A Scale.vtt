00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.400
in the kitchen weighted measures are&nbsp;
more accurate than using volume measures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.840
the metric system is based on the notion that one&nbsp;
milliliter of water is equal to one gram in weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.720
in this case we're showing that&nbsp;
300 milliliters weighs 300 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.200
similar ingredients like wine or vinegar&nbsp;
will be the same however items that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.120
lighter like in this case breadcrumbs will have a&nbsp;
different relationship between volume and weight

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:11.840
in this case 300 milliliters of breadcrumbs only&nbsp;
weighs 130 grams you can see them side by side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.400
to use the scale place the empty container&nbsp;
on the lid set the tare back to zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.200
and weigh the desired amount you can&nbsp;
then move on to your next ingredient
