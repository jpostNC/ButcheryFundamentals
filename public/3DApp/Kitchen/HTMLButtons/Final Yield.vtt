00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.902
understanding yield, why is it&nbsp;
important and where do we use it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.920
to find the yield of a product or edible&nbsp;
product, for ordering, order the right amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.525
results in less wastage, to cost recipes,&nbsp;
to find the food cost or cost per portion

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.800
what is yield factor? yield&nbsp;
factor Y or yield percentage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.320
the ratio of the useful amount after cleaning&nbsp;
or trimming compared to the as purchase product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.840
here are a few abbreviations associated with yield,&nbsp;
as purchased or AP is equal to raw ingredients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.840
edible portion EP is equal to edible portion

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.760
yield percentage of ingredients&nbsp;
EP divided by AP is equal to Y&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:18.640
this is used to find yield of an ingredient&nbsp;
EP divided by Y is equal to AP to find the AP&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.240
purchase weight AP multiplied by Y is equal&nbsp;
to EP to find the edible portion amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.840
ap dollars divided by Y is equal to ep&nbsp;
dollars to find the edible portion cost

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.680
breakdown of meats and fish all parts of the&nbsp;
product taken apart must be individually weighed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.600
during butchery there is a loss of blood moisture&nbsp;
and fat the total weight loss of all products&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
should be the same as AP weight and total cost

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.960
understanding edible product cost or ep&nbsp;
dollars, the tenderloin weighs 4 kilos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:30.320
the AP cost is $29.80 per kg the total AP cost is&nbsp;
$119.20 which is $29.80 per kg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.920
multiplied by 4 kgs equivalent to $119.20 breakdown of the tenderloin:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:53.680
fat: 15% or 600 grams, no cost to that, tip meat&nbsp;
20% or 800 grams equivalent to $23.84&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.840
usable meat 62.5% or 2.5 kgs, equivalent to $95.36

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:16.240
ep cost per kg is $95.36 divided&nbsp;
by 2.5 kgs is equal to $38.14

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.000
the new edible cost is $38.14

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.960
beef tenderloin breakdown clean&nbsp;
tenderloin chateaubriand Tournedo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.800
Tournedo portioning, tail of&nbsp;
filet mignon filet mignon tied

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.040
fish butchery breakdown:

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.400
as purchased salmon, waste&nbsp;
consisting of bones head and skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.440
edible product or EP consisting of&nbsp;
usable trim and waste edible portion

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.840
usable trim and waste consisting of&nbsp;
scrap meat off the bone and off the head

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.160
factors that may affect your yield percentage&nbsp;
an employee's skill in cleaning the product will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.440
have an enormous effect on the yield percentage,&nbsp;
skilled employees will not create as much waste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.520
the size of the product also influences the&nbsp;
yield percentage cleaning smaller carrots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.960
will create more waste and&nbsp;
a lower yield percentage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.280
the condition of the product has an effect on&nbsp;
the yield if your operation is not using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.840
freshest product available the&nbsp;
yield percentage will be lower

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.400
yield and standard portion cost&nbsp;
with meat and fish, butcher test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.680
test designed to determine standard portion&nbsp;
costs, for those items portioned before cooking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.320
cooking loss test: test used to&nbsp;
determine standard portion cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.680
for those items portioned after cooking these&nbsp;
tests are useful when purchasing and ordering

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.520
cooking loss test: tests used to determine&nbsp;
standard potion cost for those items portioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.920
after cooking it is performed on products that&nbsp;
need to be cooked before portioning and serving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:00.240
most often used on whole roast like lamb&nbsp;
beef, pork, poultry, turkey and chicken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.680
the number of portions and portion cost&nbsp;
are determined after the cooking process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.120
the actual procedure of the cooking&nbsp;
test is performed in a kitchen setting

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.200
cooking loss test: the following information is&nbsp;
recorded to determine the edible yield percentage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:35.760
the number of portions, the edible cost per pound,&nbsp;
the edible cost per portion the cost factor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.520
of the cooked product most of the steps in&nbsp;
preparing the cooking loss test are very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:52.400
similar to those applied in preparing a butcher&nbsp;
test, managing food production: food losses through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:02.160
simple product waste play a large role in overall&nbsp;
cost food waste can be the result of poor training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:11.360
dull knives, improper peeling, cutting and prepping&nbsp;
techniques improper cooking methods and techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.280
increase cooking time or temperature can&nbsp;
cause product shrinkage that increases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.040
average portion cost, over under&nbsp;
portioning affects cost and customers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.320
how to control this and for standards&nbsp;
standardized procedures and standardized recipes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.680
lastly, consistency is key&nbsp;
to success in food service
