00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
volume measures can be used for dry&nbsp;
ingredients in this case we have cup half cup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.520
quarter cup and 1/8 cup measures for&nbsp;
smaller amounts we can use measuring spoons

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:44.320
quarter teaspoon half teaspoon&nbsp;
teaspoon and tablespoon measures

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.560
for liquid measures we can use a one litre&nbsp;
cup ladles are used for portioning liquids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.600
like sauces or soups we have two&nbsp;
four six and eight ounce standards

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.400
be sure to know the equivalents&nbsp;
used in your recipe measures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.480
to show the difference&nbsp;
between water and bread crumbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.520
500 ml of water weighs 500 grams compare that&nbsp;
to breadcrumbs which are lighter than water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:42.240
500 mils of breadcrumb only weighs 180 grams this&nbsp;
would make a huge difference if you made a mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.840
in measuring ladles can be used to&nbsp;
transfer liquids or measure them

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.640
to measure flour with a cup&nbsp;
scoop and cut off the top

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.840
similarly for dry measures&nbsp;
using table or teaspoons

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.480
and for small amounts you can use teaspoon&nbsp;
measures that wouldn't show up on your scale
