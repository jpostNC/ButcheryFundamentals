00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.280
there's two classical techniques of how we&nbsp;
can add fat to meat one of them is called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.480
barding and that is when we will cover say a&nbsp;
roast piece of beef that we're going to roast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
a piece that's going to get covered in fat we'll&nbsp;
use butcher's twine we're going to tie that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.920
onto there so that as it's roasting the fat will&nbsp;
actually go into the meat and make it more moist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.080
the other way in this application&nbsp;
is what we refer to as larding this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.840
is the larding needle the point there&nbsp;
is going to get pushed through the meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.320
this little spring here is where&nbsp;
i'm going to attach some pork fat

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.120
just going to attach the pork fat to that push&nbsp;
it down nice and tight this is a little bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.000
inside round of veal obviously not a great deal&nbsp;
of fat in there so if we were to roast this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.040
by adding the pork fat running through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.840
the eye of the meat as it's roasting it&nbsp;
will help to create moisture within the meat

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.800
very carefully using the&nbsp;
needle push all the way through

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.840
and then using the applicator we're going&nbsp;
to pull that pork fat through very carefully

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.840
there's there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.920
and there's the fat running&nbsp;
through the eye of the meat
