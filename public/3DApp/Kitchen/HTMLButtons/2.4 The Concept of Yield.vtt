00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.960
in the kitchen we use a term&nbsp;
called yield factor and this refers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.120
to the edible portion compared&nbsp;
to the as purchased portion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.840
to process in this case carrots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.080
we will remove the peel and the top&nbsp;
and bottom ends as they are not edible

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.440
when we compare the edible portion to the as&nbsp;
purchased portion we will get a yield factor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.920
this is typically less than one it can be&nbsp;
expressed as that number or as a percent in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:25.840
words if it was 80% we would know that we would get&nbsp;
8 kilos edible out of every 10 kilos as purchased

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.480
once the peel is removed the top and bottom ends&nbsp;
of the carrots are removed and even if these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:53.840
are used in chicken stock we're not considering&nbsp;
them part of the edible calculation at this time

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.000
the trim or inedible portion

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:15.760
and the edible portion should equal the as&nbsp;
purchased amount you'll notice in this case if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:25.040
it's off by 10 grams it's simply because the scale&nbsp;
is not any more precise than a 10 gram increment

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.840
yield factor can be used for pricing&nbsp;
and ordering the correct amounts
