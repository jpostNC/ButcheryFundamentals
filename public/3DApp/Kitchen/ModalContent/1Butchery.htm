<p><b>Butchery</b> is the act of processing animals into smaller cuts. 
    Traditionally a butcher would slaughter, eviscerate, butcher and sell the meat from animals. In Ontario animals are slaughtered in federally and  provincially inspected facilities. The carcasses are then eviscerated and aged for a period of time before either being sold whole, split or cut into primal cuts. Butchers today also prepare value added products like meat pies, sausages, bacon, terrines and salami.
