<p>FIFO: Means  First In First Out. This is an inventory and good management strategy to ensure that you are using the oldest product first. It prevents food waste. When food is thrown out- it is the same as throwing money in the garbage. <br> 

    All products should be covered, except for hanging carcasses or meat products that are <b>dry aging.</b> 

    Never store raw meat, fish or shellfish over cooked food. <br>

    Never store raw meat fish or shellfish over raw vegetables or fruit <br>

    Raw meat, fish or shellfish should be stored as close to the coldest part of the fridge as possible <br>

    Fish and Shellfish should be stored on crushed ice. <br>

    Never put hot foods into a fridge- this can raise the temperature of the fridge and put the fridge items in the danger zone. <br>

    Fridge temperatures should be monitored throughout the day, it is Good Manufacturing Practice to keep a detailed log of temperatures and times when it was checked. <br>

<p><b>Dry Aging:</b> A process of allowing the natural enzymes to break down connective tissue in beef to make it more tender and flavourful. Dry aging is expensive due to moisture loss. Primal cuts are usually dry aged. Dry aging is considered more flavourful than wet aging. Temperatures and humidity are controlled to ensure food safety.</p>
