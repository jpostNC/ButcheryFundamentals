<p> <b>General Butchery Guidelines </b>
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Proteins are prepared by the butcher by seaming one muscle from another muscle, creating a usable product for the chef.</li>
        <li>All muscles are separated from other muscles by a line of fat or an obvious bone.</li>
        <li>When seaming out muscles, use the tip of your knife and pull with your hands. Let gravity help you.</li>
        <li>Knife Work First - Anatomy Second: when you learn to seam one muscle from another, you can then proceed to learn more about anatomy.</li>
        <li>Always keep your work surface organized dry and clean </li>
        <li>Protect your non-knife hand</li>
        <li>Don't pick up anything up unless you know where you will put it down</li>
        <li>Knives are used to cut meat, saws are used to cut bone, not the other way around</li>
        <li>The more a muscle is used the more tough it will become, also it will be more flavourful. The more tender cuts tend to be more expensive and less flavourful.</li>
        <li>Try to leave as little meat on the bone as possible. (Unless the point is to have a bone with lots of meat, as with ribs or rib steaks)</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p> <b>Knife rules-</b>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Point the tip down when walking- announce loudly “Knife” so others know that there is a potential danger. Never ever walk with a knife pointed in front of you.</li>
    <li>When passing a knife to someone, present the handle to them, never hand them the blade.</li>
    <li>Keep your knife sharp: dull knives are dangerous as you have to apply more pressure and if you slip you can get a bad cut. </li>
    <li>Keep your knives dry, your hand can slip over a handle onto the blade and your fingers will get sliced.</li>
    <li>Never leave blades in a sink so that you or someone else can get cut.</li>
    <li>Let a falling knife fall, do not try to catch it. </li>
    <li>Keep your knives clean</li>
</ol>

<p> <b>Cutting rules:</b>
    It takes practice to become proficient as a butcher or meat cutter, you will make mistakes, but you will get better. In a butcher shop it takes time to butcher animals into fabricated cuts. Time costs money when you take into account wages. A general rule when cutting and determining how much meat to leave on bone or skin and how much time to dedicate to it is to follow the 5% rule. <br>

    <b>5% Rule:</b> If there is more than 5% of meat  on a piece of connective tissue, bone or fat, take the time to remove it to make usable trim. If there is less than 5% meat leave it where it is. <br>

    <b>Usable trim:</b> edible meat that is trimmed off of a fabricated cut or bone or fat. Used to make other value added products like sausage or burgers or meat pies. <br>
