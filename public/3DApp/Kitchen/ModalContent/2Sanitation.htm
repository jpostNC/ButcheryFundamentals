<p>It is imperative that a cook or butcher practices safe food handling procedures to ensure that any meat handled is safe and fit for human consumption
</p>

<p>In the butcher shop the 3 Cs are practiced- Clean, Cold, Covered</p>

<p><b>Clean: </b></p>

<p>This means food, clothes, hands, equipment, tools and the facility should be kept clean and sanitized. Most butcher shops practise Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Meat Processing Plants following Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) certifications. In Ontario butcher shops and retail food stores are inspected by municipal health units. </p>

<p>The Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) is responsible for policy, legislation, and regulation in Ontario's food and agriculture sector. Their Meat Regulation States:  </p>

<p>“Regulation 31/05 (Meat) under the Food Safety and Quality Act, 2001 is administered by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA). Its purpose is to help ensure that meat processed for consumption in Ontario meets food safety requirements. The regulation sets out requirements to ensure that animals are fit for slaughter, handled humanely and processed under sanitary conditions. All species of mammals and birds, raised in captivity and whose meat is intended for human consumption, are included in the regulation.</p>

<p>Under the regulation, all meat destined for sale or distribution, without exception, must originate from livestock or poultry slaughtered in provincially licensed or federally registered establishments, or imported from a federally recognized source.</p>

<p>In Ontario, <b>no one can sell, transport, deliver or distribute meat unless:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The animal was inspected prior to slaughter (ante mortem), approval for slaughter in accordance with the Meat Regulation, and the carcass was inspected following slaughter (post mortem) and was approved for use as food in accordance with the Meat Regulation or the regulations under the Meat Inspection Act (Canada);</li>
    <li>The animal was slaughtered in a plant operated by a provincially licensed operator or a federally registered establishment; and</li>
    <li>The meat is stamped, labelled or tagged with an inspection legend”. (OMAFRA)</li>
  </ul>  

<p>The assumption when receiving meat from an abattoir, a meat processing plant or butcher shop is that the meat has been inspected and is fit for human consumption and is therefore clean. However, mistakes can happen, check the box and package for dates and in the case of pork and chicken a smell test can determine whether the product is still fresh.</p>

<p>If you think the product is rotten contact your supplier immediately and DO NOT USE IT. </p>

<p>Hands must  be washed and sanitized prior to touching any food, tools or equipment.</p>

<p>Fingernails should always be kept clean and short.</p>

<p>Clean equipment & food surfaces thoroughly with HOT SOAPY WATER, SANITIZER SOLUTION & A CLEAN TOWEL to avoid bacterial growth which can cause food borne illness.</p>

<p><i>Personal Hygiene & Grooming</i></p>

<p>WASH YOUR HANDS - this is your best defense against viral & bacterial contamination </p>

<p>Ideally gloves should be worn when handling raw meat products. </p>

<p><b>Cold:</b></p>

<p>Bacteria grows exponentially when it enters the danger zone 39-140 ℉ (4-60℃) - food should be stored or handled at 4℃ or lower. Raw Meat should not be above 4℃ for longer than 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>Covered: </b></p>

<p>Once meat has been fabricated into portioned cuts it should be covered to protect it from odours, cross contamination and oxidation by air. Larger primal cuts are not covered in order to allow them to dry and age.</p>

<p><b>Abattoir:</b> a place where animals are killed, inspected, and butchered.
    Sanitizer: a chemical solution used to make surfaces of hands, shoes, equipment, tools, and tables, clean from harmful bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Bacterial growth:</b> the rate at which bacteria grow.  Can be slowed by controlling  temperature, time, pH levels, oxygen and moisture.</p>

<p><b>Food-born illness:</b> There are at least 30 bacteria, parasites and viruses known to cause food-borne illness. These are called pathogens. Many of these pathogens are tracked by public health surveillance systems that monitor cases of illness. (Canada)</p>
