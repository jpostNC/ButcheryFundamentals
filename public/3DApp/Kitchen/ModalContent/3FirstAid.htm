<p>The butcher shop or kitchen presents a number of potential dangers to humans. It is very important that you are aware of these dangers to prevent accidents. Some examples of potential dangers are: 
</p>

<p>Cuts from knives, saws and equipment.</p>

<p>Chemical burns from cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>Eye injuries from chemicals, blood or bone fragments.</p>

<p>Large primal animal cuts can be heavy and can cause muscle strain. </p>

<p>Every kitchen or butcher shop should be equipped with a well stocked first aid kit. This is the law.</p>

<p>Cuts, burns or open wounds should be covered by a bandage and gloves to prevent contamination of the meat. This also protects you  from contamination. <b>Band aids must be covered by a latex or vinyl glove or cot.</b></p>

<p>If you cut yourself, put your knife down (not on the cutting board) and cover the wound with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding. Let your manager or chef know that you have been injured. Once you have performed first aid, cleaned and covered your wound with a bandage and a glove and washed your hands then you will inspect your station. If you bled on the meat product it is no longer fit for human consumption and must be discarded. Wash and sanitize your knife and station and anywhere else that you might have bled before you continue. </p>

<p>According to the Environmental Working Group’s Meat Eater’s Guide Report pork raised in the US has the 4th  full lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Lamb, Beef and Cheese produce more emissions than pork.</p>
