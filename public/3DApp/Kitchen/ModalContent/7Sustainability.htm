<p> Each module in this course will give an overview of different practices associated with that moduleâ€™s topic that relate to sustainability. It is important to remember that there is a difference in food that is produced in conventional methods where large scale farming practices are employed and food that is produced by small scale farmers or farmers who only breed heritage animals. Animals that are raised in conventional farms are bred and raised to get to a market weight as quickly and nutritionally as possible. Those animals would have been bred over a number of years to produce cross breeds that have distinct characteristics favorable to market conditions and the North American environment. Chickens that are grown for meat production have been bred and are fed a diet to get them to a harvest weight in 42 days. A heritage chicken living off outfits natural food might take 6 months to reach a harvest weight. This is why heritage breeds are more expensive than conventionally bred animals- the longer a farmer has to feed and water an animal the more expensive it becomes, but it also becomes more flavorful.

    Regardless of the arguments for or against large scale factory farmed animals butchers can still practice sustainability in good practices in their shops and kitchens such as: <br>
    Buying fresh animals <br>
    Developing relationships with farmers and suppliers <br>
    Using whole animals <br>
    Respecting their products <br>
    Not wasting product <br>
    Being creative with trim to make burgers, sausages or other value added quick service food items. <br>
    Using bones to make stock. <br>
    Donate fat with companies who recycle it into other products like soap or cosmetics. <br>
    Use composting for anything that cannot be recycled <br>
    Use a 3 bowl system when cutting. One bowl for usable trim, one bowl for garbage and one bowl for unusable trim (to be recycled or composted.  <br>

<p><b>Heritage breed:</b> a breed of animal that has not been crossbred with other breeds to in order maintain their unique historical characteristics. Most commercial breeds have been crossbred for many reasons- to make them more, or less, cold weather tolerant; to make them less or more fatty.</p>

<p><b>Market weight:</b> required weight of an animal set by the market, a farmer will feed and raise animals to get them to market weight.  </p>
