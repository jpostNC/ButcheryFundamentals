00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.400
looking at our whole rabbit from the top side down&nbsp;
again four-legged animal super lean very low on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.480
fat in terms of cooking how do we cook this very&nbsp;
similar to any other four-legged animal regardless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.480
to size this is a great indication of how&nbsp;
the different methods applied to different cuts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.360
so the more muscles are worked the more tough&nbsp;
they become and then we as cooks and chefs have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.200
different cooking methods applied to them so the&nbsp;
back legs or the hind legs they work a lot we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.840
thinking about how this this animal would move&nbsp;
they're suitable for moist methods of cooking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.520
stewing and braising in addition to the  fore legs&nbsp;
same idea it's the middle part that is suitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.080
for dry method of cooking roasting grilling pan&nbsp;
roasting the saddle and the ribs some restaurants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:01.840
go to the extra step of taking these ribs cleaning&nbsp;
them up and making little tiny rabbit racks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.920
that is additional technique here but this&nbsp;
gives you a better idea of the tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.520
and the loin and again this is suitable for&nbsp;
sparse and dry method of cooking
