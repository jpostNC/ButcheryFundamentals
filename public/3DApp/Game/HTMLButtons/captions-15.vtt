00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.680
here we have our rack of deer, rib cap has&nbsp;
been removed next step is to remove the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.680
silver skin it's very similar to removing&nbsp;
silver skin from a tenderloin or removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.560
skin from a fish so starting&nbsp;
with a manageable size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.000
this is very expensive very tender meat&nbsp;
your knife tip is just underneath holding on

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.840
maybe scraping away a little bit of the fat&nbsp;
if it's there so you can access the chewy

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.760
silver skin that will not break down

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.320
so getting a little piece here my knife is&nbsp;
going up I'm tilting the edge of my knife upward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.360
seesaw motion down the rack

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.760
like so as you can see when I flip this&nbsp;
over I there is some trim that I can utilize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.280
and it doesn't look like much&nbsp;
with one piece of silver skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
but if you're doing many&nbsp;
then this certainly adds up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.840
so this is very tender, this would be very tender

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.640
so again tip of the knife under

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.560
slightly upward and continuing to&nbsp;
remove the silver skin off the deer rack
