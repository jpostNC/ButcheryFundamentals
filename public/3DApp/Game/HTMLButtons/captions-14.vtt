00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.160
this is a eight bone rack of deer the there's&nbsp;
a term venison that's all-encompassing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.440
includes deer, elk, caribou, moose for this one you&nbsp;
could see looking at the two eye this one is quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.640
round and large this is the loin end this one has&nbsp;
a flap this is the shoulder end underneath this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.120
flap is the actual rack with the bone attached&nbsp;
so what I'm going to do is remove this

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.440
flap of meat or fat and then&nbsp;
remove some of the silver skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.840
so removing the rib cap is doesn't require a&nbsp;
lot of knife work but a little bit if there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.640
a slight resistance so I'm just pulling it&nbsp;
from the bone side and you can see there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:11.840
little bit of webbing and with little easy&nbsp;
strokes of your knife it should give way

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:25.840
careful not to damage the actual meat

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.880
this can be further this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:40.160
rib cap which i'll show you in a moment can be&nbsp;
further butchered and trimmed rather

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.760
as you can see all the excess meat and&nbsp;
this could be ground for sausage or burgers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560
so that's the rib cap
