00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.680
so now we have our beautiful duck now this is&nbsp;
very I think it's probably one of my favorite uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:14.240
poultries that I mean not only all poultries&nbsp;
have fat with the skin dog particularly is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920
is probably one of the most delicate fats that&nbsp;
you will find it helps us once we render the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.560
fat I want you guys to take a look at this&nbsp;
all these I'm gonna be cutting all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.080
all of these won't be going to waste i'm&nbsp;
gonna render this make it into a liquid uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.040
fat sort of source and when I use that to&nbsp;
comfy our legs I want to use that to cook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.440
you know the side dishes that we might be serving&nbsp;
with with our beautiful dog with potatoes beets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.440
asparagus anything like that can&nbsp;
be cooked with dog fight as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.000
so the same structure as the chicken you have the&nbsp;
breast you have the thigh you have the drumstick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.040
and then you have the wings as well notice&nbsp;
that the wing in itself unlike the breaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.320
unlike the chicken it does not have as much&nbsp;
muscle right here so therefore the meat that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.160
you may get it from here um it's not as as as&nbsp;
pronounced as you would do it with with chicken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.320
uh the first thing I'm gonna do I'm just&nbsp;
gonna remove some of the fat from here now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.440
this fat as I mentioned earlier will not dispose&nbsp;
to this okay this is excellent for rendering fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.600
and we're going to use that fat for confine&nbsp;
not just the dog but different things like like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.640
vegetables and and other meats as well okay just&nbsp;
like this perfect so now what we're going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.320
i'm going to flip this bird I'm going&nbsp;
to identify where the oyster muscles are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.040
which are right here I'm going to make the little&nbsp;
cross right here this is going to be my guide to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.360
know where am I going to be slicing the meats okay&nbsp;
so I'm just going to go through these like these

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.480
to that point

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840
the same on the other leg

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.080
now myoglobin is a concentration&nbsp;
of blood basically on the muscles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.040
and the way it works is the more the&nbsp;
muscle is used the more concentration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.800
of myoglobin would happen and the the color&nbsp;
of the the muscle would change to a darker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.960
a darker red okay and that is the reason&nbsp;
why with duck and goose um because of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.440
concentration of myoglobin because of the they&nbsp;
use the muscles to fly and and to move and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.040
so that concentration allows us to have to be&nbsp;
able to cook the breasts for example on dock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.120
to a medium rare where or a medium where a chicken&nbsp;
has to be cooked all the way throughout okay

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.320
remove this part off

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.480
and then here you have a beautiful&nbsp;
i'm just to slice this very quickly

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.640
a beautiful dark breast that could&nbsp;
be cured and then it could be pansier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.440
and serve medium rare medium medium well&nbsp;
whatever whatever your customer desires
