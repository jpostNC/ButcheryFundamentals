00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.960
this is a technique that can be&nbsp;
used not just for rabbit but any meat where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.280
you want to add flavor and moisture rabbit is&nbsp;
particularly lean so the bacon fat will really add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.080
the flavor to it and also moistness&nbsp;
as I just mentioned through roasting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.920
so I have some bacon laid out here and on plastic&nbsp;
and I'm just going to fold it over and flatten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.360
it, I have a rolling pin so I'm just going to&nbsp;
lightly make it a bit thinner and even thickness

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.400
um barding is used in this case with bacon&nbsp;
but barding can be done also with caul fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.200
which the culinary term once it's wrapped and&nbsp;
roasted is "en crepinette", so the bacon is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.840
smoother and not so bumpy and of even thickness&nbsp;
the loin or the saddle is here we I did add the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.640
two loins in as well just for the purpose of the&nbsp;
demonstration of rolling a little bit of seasoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.840
keeping in mind that there is some saltiness from&nbsp;
the bacon so I have some salt and cracked pepper

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.920
tucking it in rolling it over one full&nbsp;
one and when this is eventually roasted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.560
and sliced this will be the top so&nbsp;
keep that in mind when you're rolling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.360
placing it right on this can be trimmed after&nbsp;
so when I'm roasting I want the bottom seam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.440
on the bottom when I'm initially&nbsp;
searing in the pan straight over like so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.480
i'm going to keep this plastic because i&nbsp;
want to set it up in the fridge and chill it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.920
so you can see it has a nice it's&nbsp;
almost doubled in size from the farce or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.800
the filling rolling it over taking the ends&nbsp;
and I'm going to secure this alternatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
you can go straight from this stage&nbsp;
and truss it with butcher's twine

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.960
doing one side

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.920
nice little sort of tight final roll the other

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.040
you can maybe not be so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.320
give yourself a little bit more plastic&nbsp;
wrap securing both sides and as mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.040
i would then put this in the fridge&nbsp;
to chill for roasting at a later time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.400
when I'm ready to roast it i'll take it out of&nbsp;
the fridge remove the plastic wrap before roasting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.480
and add to a preheated pan&nbsp;
or into a preheated oven
