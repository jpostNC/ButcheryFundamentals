00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.960
okay welcome my name is Luis Valenzeula I'm going to&nbsp;
be your butcher instructor for everything poultry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.160
today um we have a beautiful tray here&nbsp;
with different birds we have our chicken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.840
we have duck we have turkey and we have quail now&nbsp;
it's important to I want to emphasize that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.440
these birds however different in size they are&nbsp;
the same in bone structure and and and muscle mass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
for example you have quail here where you&nbsp;
have the keel bone right here you have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.240
two breasts right here you have the wings you have&nbsp;
the legs right here with the thigh and the drumstick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.160
you have the back the back bone right here&nbsp;
and then you have the oyster muscles right here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
if we go to the larger bird which is a turkey&nbsp;
will have the same thing we have the breast right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.120
here here on the side you can see the thigh very&nbsp;
clearly the the drumstick very clearly as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.720
flip this over we have the oy- that we have&nbsp;
the oyster bone muscles right here we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.960
our backbone right here all the way to the neck&nbsp;
and we have our wings so once you learn how to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.520
one bird you can do all of them and this part&nbsp;
of course it only happens with turkey and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.640
sometimes with duck it does not happen with quail&nbsp;
or chicken where you would often find inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.880
cavity the neck the liver and sometimes the heart&nbsp;
in a little pouch or just like this okay these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.760
are called offals and they're great to so you&nbsp;
don't discard them you don't dispose them they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.320
fantastic to make pates they're incredible to make&nbsp;
stocks or sauces jus anything like that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.680
at the neck is full of flavor of course the heart&nbsp;
you can make different you know you can grill them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.480
pan sear them serve them in many different&nbsp;
applications here on the duck which I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.400
show you right here in the cavity careful with&nbsp;
your hands I'm pulling all the liver from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.240
now just want you guys to&nbsp;
see how beautiful this is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.240
now all of these the reason why um the offals&nbsp;
are not in the chicken is because often at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.000
butcher shop you would find the the offal from&nbsp;
chicken sold separately right where duck and turkey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.840
um because they don't sell enough turkeys&nbsp;
they would just stuff the offals inside
