Hi so welcome my name is chef Susie Redding&nbsp;
i'm with George Brown College in Toronto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.360
um this week we're talking about furred game furred&nbsp;
and feathered game here we have a deer rack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:27.120
deer t-bone elk top sirloin bore loin bison top&nbsp;
sirloin and a full rabbit interestingly enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.760
all these animals are four legged animals and they&nbsp;
are all represented in the rabbit so for instance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.880
the rack of deer would come from this part of the&nbsp;
rabbit the t-bone that has both the loin and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.760
tenderloin comes from the this loin part up into&nbsp;
the lower rib of the rabbit the top sirloin of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.880
the elk and the bison come from the sort of rump&nbsp;
or butt area or hind lake portion of the rabbit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.520
and then the bore loin comes from the center most&nbsp;
meaty part on the rabbit or any four-legged animal
