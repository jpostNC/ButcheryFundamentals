00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.920
this is a recall frenching the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.120
this is a double chop of deer when frenching&nbsp;
the bones the idea is you're exposing the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.920
for aesthetics and the side benefit when we clean&nbsp;
it up we can use the meat in between the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.400
in another way like for grinding for sausage meat&nbsp;
uh when we decide how where do we french here here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.600
here or here one way is chefs usually do from the&nbsp;
first first digit of the thumb up from the bone my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.040
training was whatever the eye the size is the same&nbsp;
amount for balance going back to the full rack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.120
when you're frenching a full rack you would notch&nbsp;
one side notch the other and then join them up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.840
so for this one I'm going to do the double so&nbsp;
about here and scoring it right down to the bone

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.520
making a little incision between the bones and now&nbsp;
the job is to remove the bone the meat from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.320
bone to make a cleaner bone so holding it up going&nbsp;
down one side holding it and going up the other

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600
going down one side remember this&nbsp;
is normally done with a full rack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.680
or a chop and here we have again the meat that&nbsp;
we can use for grinding from between the bones

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.720
using the base of my knife scraping the bones

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.680
you can just kind of make it make&nbsp;
it a little bit easier I'm breaking

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.120
the bit of wrapping around&nbsp;
the bowl for easy access and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.840
you're going to be scraping them&nbsp;
down to make them super clean

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.240
when you get a certain point where it's loosened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.000
you can take a clean cloth and then pull it off&nbsp;
here we have a beautiful double bone deer chop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.840
super expensive probably one of the most expensive&nbsp;
cuts on the animal next to the loin or equivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.680
you can see there's hardly any fat so of course&nbsp;
dry method cooking for this nice high heat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.880
very nutritious amazing color the bones are&nbsp;
frenched nice and clean and there we have it
