00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.760
rack of deer: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,&nbsp;
eight bone you can see how tender this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.960
is suitable for dry heat method as a whole or&nbsp;
breaking it down into two bone chops would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.400
one portion beautiful flavor super rich color&nbsp;
and I'm just going to turn it over to show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.960
the bone structure so the bones do have a curve so&nbsp;
when you're cutting to make a portion whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.120
two bone or a single chop you want to stick as close as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.800
and then the same with the next so I'm going to&nbsp;
demonstrate a two bone chop and when I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.200
this I will position it kind of like for you to&nbsp;
see it this is very similar to a rack of lamb from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.840
lamb week that you french so we could clean these&nbsp;
up a bit more but they look good so following

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.760
the bone all the way down gives&nbsp;
us a nice beautiful double chop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.200
with a huge eye again following the bone

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.840
when you get down there's a little jog&nbsp;
a little curve and here's another one

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.080
following the bone

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.240
and so we end up with

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.000
eight bones but four portions of double rack
