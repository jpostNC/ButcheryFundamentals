1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.436
Here we have to cut from the loin of boar.

2
00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.973
So if we backtrack
and think of the other game we saw today

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.876
and thinking back to the rabbit,
the whole thing

4
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.445
This would be from the rabbit saddle.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.915
very similar to pork.

6
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.752
Pigs are not indigenous to North America.

7
00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.321
They were introduced by settlers.

8
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.523
And through that introduction,

9
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:28.161
also were boar introduced,
but not so much as a food source,

10
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.097
but more for gaming.

11
00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:36.302
They did become feral, and that's how
we now have boar in North America.

12
00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:40.940
However, just to be clear,
this game has been raised in captivity.

13
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.177
And so although it's wild,
it still has to meet

14
00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.580
the regulations
set by the province and the country.
