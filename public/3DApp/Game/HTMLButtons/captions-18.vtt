00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.160
here we have two steaks, they're t-bone steaks&nbsp;
of deer, this is an extension of the loin so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.240
we had the rack earlier, in another segment,&nbsp;
and this is an extension so here we have on one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.760
side making it a "T" or separating by a "T" is&nbsp;
the tenderloin and the loin so you can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.000
remove this completely and just have a loin or&nbsp;
a tenderloin thinking back to the beef segment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the porterhouse steak or the t-bone steak&nbsp;
was three times the size looking at the color&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.560
and the marbling of this is very lean again&nbsp;
beautiful color suitable for high heat dry cooking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.800
and any kind of game meat the flavor&nbsp;
profile I'm pairing really goes well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.720
with dried fruits fresh fruits robust herbs&nbsp;
such as marjoram, sage, thyme, rosemary, savory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.920
it also prepares well with sweet wine such as&nbsp;
port or any kind of fruit wines and again it it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.040
the flavor profile of this really it's not super&nbsp;
gamey but if it does have a degree of gaminess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.720
will be compensated or the the flavor profile&nbsp;
plays with the sweetness and the dried fruits

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.360
here we have two very different members of the&nbsp;
venison family a recall on the t-bone of deer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.920
with the tenderloin and the loin attached and&nbsp;
over here is a top strip loin steak of elk you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.400
can see the very different color in the meats and&nbsp;
also the density of the meat this one is much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.240
dense it's a bigger animal than the deer taking&nbsp;
a look at the fat it also doesn't give well to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.600
it of course it's protecting it and keeping it&nbsp;
moisture and cooking but it's not very palatable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:04.800
and if you do consume it it's it's not very tasty&nbsp;
like the deer elk is also well suited to stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.160
flavors as mentioned before dried fruits and&nbsp;
robust herbs in addition to toasted warm spices

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.000
here is a steak from the top sirloin of&nbsp;
bison, bison is very similar in structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.960
both in its muscular and skeletal&nbsp;
structure to cattle and so this looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.280
doesn't really indicate how large the&nbsp;
animal is but it is from the top sirloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.840
the color is very different from&nbsp;
beef bison has been grass-fed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.840
free range ideally where as mentioned in beef&nbsp;
week, beef are often fattened up with corn and soy
