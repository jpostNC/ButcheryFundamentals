    In Canada, wild game such as moose meat is not Federally inspected. The only expected compliance is to have this meat stored separately from Domestic meat. In Ontario,  game such as bison, boar, elk and caribou served by restaurants today is farmed.  However in Newfoundland, they are allowed to hunt, kill and serve moose and caribou that are hunted in their natural habitat. <br>
