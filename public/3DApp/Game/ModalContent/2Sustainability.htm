<p>Wild game and fish sustained indigenous peoples for thousands of years prior to settler contact. Wild game and foods that are naturally raised or harvested provide a more nutrient rich food source than processed foods. Bison once roamed the vast plains of North America but were hunted to near extinction by the 1880s.” A major role in the bison’s demise was also U.S. government policy aimed at taking away a key food source for Indigenous peoples, thus restricting their independence. The Canadian government in turn used the demise of the bison to coerce Indigenous peoples to comply with government settlement policy. The bison’s demise greatly changed the lifestyles of the Métis and other Plains Indigenous peoples.” (Canadian Geographic) The bison carcasses were left to rot once their hides were removed. The vast herds that once existed here have been reduced to 13,000 wild bison left in Canada.

<p> <b>Food Sovereignty</b> is defined as, "the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems." La Via Campesina
    </p>

<p><b>Indigenous food sovereignty</b> is a specific policy approach to addressing the underlying issues impacting Indigenous peoples and our ability to respond to our own needs for healthy, culturally adapted Indigenous foods.” (Indigenous Food Systems Network)</p>

<p>Indigenous peoples who have been removed from their land or access to their culturally appropriate food face very different health issues not experienced by settlers. As Settee and Shukla write in their book, Indigenous Food Systems, state:</p>

<p>“Indigenous Peoples in Canada are non-industrialized peoples, meaning that until fairly recently many were hunters and gatherers. The lack of Indigenous foods (such as deer, moose, elk, muskrat, and berries) and the imposition of unhealthy market-based processed foods, which are often high in sugar, salt, and trans-fat, create unique health problems. Loss of limbs, loss of sight, and early death as a result of diabetes are epidemic in many Indigenous communities. The rate of diabetes is three to five times higher for Indigenous people than the general population (Diabetes Canada, 2018). Tuberculosis was once eradicated but has now made a return because of crowded, mould-ridden, inadequate homes and unhealthy diets. Due to persistent issues of food insecurity, diabetes and many other health-related illnesses, and poverty, the life expectancy rate for Indigenous people is 10 to 15 years shorter than for non-Indigenous people (Statistics Canada, 2018).” (Settee & Shukla, 2020, p. 5)</p>

<p>It is important to note that wild foods, or animals who are farmed with access to their own natural foods will provide more nutrients than animals who are raised with foods designed to fatten them as quickly and nutritionally as possible.</p>
