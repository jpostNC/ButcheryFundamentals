<p>When cooking game meat, follow the concepts covered in earlier modules to determine how to cook the desired muscle. Remember, the more a muscle works the more tough it will be. Tough muscles are best cooked low and slow, with moist heat cooking methods like stewing and braising. Tender cuts can be grilled, seared, or roasted.</p>

<p>Factors that determine the quality of the animal are: the age of the animal, its diet, the time of year the animal was killed, the stress it may have endured.</p>

<p>When it comes to large game, raw cuts of meat are classified as either: tender, medium-tender or tough. Tender cuts come from the softer regions of the animal (back, inside). The more tender the cut of meat is, the quicker it cooks to an appropriate level of doneness and the better suited it would be to dry heat cooking methods such as grilling or broiling.  Often the meat from wild animals is less tender due to the fact they move more in the wild. This also results in a leaner meat.</p>

<p>Tough cuts of meat come from the parts of the animal where the muscles are heavily exercised (front forequarter). These cuts have more connective tissue and therefore take longer to cook, as connective tissue takes longer to break down.  Older animals tend to have tougher meat than young animals. Due to length of cooking time, they are better suited to a combination of moist and dry heat cooking methods such as stewing and braising or grinding for use in sausages and burgers. </p>

<p>Medium-tender cuts fall in the middle category and are suited to either dry or combination heat cooking methods, depending on the cut.</p>

<p>Health Canada recommends that game be cooked to an internal cooking temperature of 165℉ / 74℃. Bison and venison can be cooked to lower temperatures like beef.</p>

<p>Bison is very similar to beef in taste and texture. The biggest difference is that they are lean and can require added fat while cooking, in order to not dry out. Additionally, if the farm does ‘fatten’ the bison by feeding it grain prior to slaughter, the fat does not marble. It lies underneath the skin of the animal and is easily removed.<br>

<p>Deer - to reduce the 'gamey' flavour profile, ensure the deer fat is removed.  Deer is very lean and can require added fat when using dry heat cooking methods. It also cooks well by using moist heat cooking methods. Deer - to reduce the ‘gamey’ flavour profile, ensure the deer fat is removed.

<p><b>Gamey:</b> means having a strong smell and flavour. A strong unknown flavour and taste can be concluded as gamey. As meat ages and gets close to spoilage, the term “gamey” is used.</p>

<p>Boar, while very similar to pork, has a darker color meat, a richer flavour and more fat which makes it versatile.<br>

<p>Traditionally Indigenous peoples preferred to hunt older animals due to their higher fat content which was valuable for flavouring and preserving meat. (Wolfman, 2017)</p>
