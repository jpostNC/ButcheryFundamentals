<p>Some restaurants in Ontario will label the menu items as “wild game” or “wild boar.” This is a misnomer. The animals served were once wild but have been farmed so that they can be inspected prior to being sold to the public.  It is illegal to serve wild animals in foodservice operations in Ontario. Ontario has a vibrant recreational hunting and fishing industry, but the animals harvested cannot be sold to foodservice industries. Some butcher shops offer services to clean, butcher, package and offer value-added cooked products for hunters and their hunted wild game. </p>

<p><b>Game:</b> is a term applied to wild animals that we eat. They are categorized as large and small. Elk, deer, moose, reindeer, caribou are classified as large game and are collectively known as Venison.  Buffalo, wild boar and bear are other large animals that live in the wild. Small game animals are  rabbits, squirrels, beavers and muskrats.  The taste of wild game varies from animal to animal and throughout the year because, in nature, animals eat different foods at different times of the year.</p>

<p><b>Boar:</b> a tusked Eurasian wild pig not native to North America. Pigs were introduced to Canada by European settlers. Wild Boars were introduced to North America and released into the wild by European hunters. These boars and pigs have crossbred and are now an invading species in the US and Canada. </p>
