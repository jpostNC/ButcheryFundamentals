00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.600
whole rabbit, top side looking top&nbsp;
side, just taking a look before i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.360
start my butchery removing any excess fat&nbsp;
but keep in mind it is extremely lean animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.680
and that is any sort of fat&nbsp;
that was connected to the offal

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.600
and making my

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.160
areas as neat as possible before I start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.960
so I can see where my knife is&nbsp;
going in the butchery process

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.000
flipping it back first thing I'm going&nbsp;
to do is remove the two  fore legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.280
one and two, these  fore legs are not in&nbsp;
a socket they are floating so what I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.160
to do is take my knife and trace around&nbsp;
it's sort of like the shoulder and take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.160
it off in one one go maybe two but there's no&nbsp;
looking for the joints there is no joint here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.480
same with the other side so starting with one&nbsp;
just tracing it first and I'm holding the  fore leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:19.280
in my hand and removing it as such so&nbsp;
again I'm taking my knife it is a floating

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.280
joint I guess and holding it and just following it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200
and removing it like so so there is a bone here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.960
shoulder blade in there and&nbsp;
here are the two  fore legs
