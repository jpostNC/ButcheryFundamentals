00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.720
this is the loin section of the rabbit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:11.040
belly flap, spine intact, bone in. what&nbsp;
i'm going to do is remove the bone

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.440
creating a saddle totally deboned tenderloin&nbsp;
two two loin and with the flap it's ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.040
to be stuffed and roasted so using my knife this&nbsp;
is kind of a bit finicky this kind of butchery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.680
so my knife tip is looking for the underside of&nbsp;
the spine or the spine and with the my whole knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.000
i'm now I feel the bone so I'm scraping&nbsp;
it upward and you can see I'm revealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.360
the underside of the spine by doing&nbsp;
so I can take off the tenderloin

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.840
ideally in one piece

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.640
i'm going to turn it around and do the exact same&nbsp;
thing on the other side my knife as the guide to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.280
the spine, upward motion following removing&nbsp;
the tenderloin and these come away very easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.840
one and two and what I'm doing now is exposing the&nbsp;
bone so the bone kind of flares up on both sides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.640
the spine and then it goes back down so&nbsp;
working on one side I'm using the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.840
length of my knife to find those bones and with my&nbsp;
food hand pulling the meat away at the same time

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.440
when I my knife is hitting more bone I stop&nbsp;
and I'm going to turn my knife again toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.840
my food food hand and scrape it okay so i've&nbsp;
just flipped around the saddle so you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.840
see so to recap the two tenderloins are off i&nbsp;
am my knife is touching the spine i've taken it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.840
underneath to this these bones blade upward and&nbsp;
now downward and my knife tip is hitting bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.840
and I want to expose as much as&nbsp;
of that as possible by scraping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.680
that's one side I'm going to turn it&nbsp;
over and show again so one side went up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.840
finding using the whole length of my&nbsp;
knife and tracing the bone structure

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.280
straight scraping downward so what&nbsp;
i'm left with is two loins and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.000
belly flap but it's still attached to the spine&nbsp;
so this is where it might get a little bit tricky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.360
because of these notches opening it up right here&nbsp;
i want to separate the meat from the bone so just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.320
double triple checking that I can go as far as&nbsp;
i can and I'm going to take the tip of my knife

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.320
and trace underside

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.080
turning it over doing the same thing

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.440
remember the idea is take the meat

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.320
away from the spine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.640
okay so here we are we have the spine, the two&nbsp;
loins and the belly flap the intent of this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.240
to remove it intact to create a saddle which will&nbsp;
later be stuffed, so thinking about those notches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:59.840
on the spine carefully I'm putting my knife in&nbsp;
and I want to follow those notches and remove

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.360
the meat from the spine

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.720
if there are any little rib bones that&nbsp;
you may have missed you'll find them in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.840
there may be some resistance, but there&nbsp;
isn't, one last one getting in there

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.560
cleaning my board

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.040
and then opening up the saddle
