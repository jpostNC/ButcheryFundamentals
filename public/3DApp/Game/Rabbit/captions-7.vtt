00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.720
the next cut of the rabbit is to remove&nbsp;
any of the neck portion and the tail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.200
and then we're left with two pieces: the rib section and the loin section so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.800
this will then be further divided from the lowest&nbsp;
rib separating the loin the saddle from the ribs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
okay so I'm going to be removing the&nbsp;
lower spine part as well as the neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.840
and to do that I'm switching up my&nbsp;
knife something a bit more heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.400
turning it over scoring it seeing where&nbsp;
my knife is going and then slight pressure

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
through the bone there's one

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.960
same with the neck and is this completely&nbsp;
necessary? no, but it does make a cleaner work area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:09.200
so once again first exposing the bone seeing&nbsp;
where my knife is going and light pressure
