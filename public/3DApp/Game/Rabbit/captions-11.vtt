00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.920
here we have the rib section of the rabbit&nbsp;
what I'm going to do eventually is remove the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.240
loin what's left of it up at the top here and&nbsp;
also kind of trim off these bones alternatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
you can do a cross cut and&nbsp;
make little rabbit chops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.800
here we have first I'm just&nbsp;
going to trim any of this excess

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.600
belly and remember this would be used for&nbsp;
stock this is part of the sternum coming off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.840
as you can see the ribs underneath to access those

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:54.160
loins I'm removing also some of this flat&nbsp;
meat turning it around just for easier access

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.200
and now the two loins are&nbsp;
exposed following the spine

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.080
with the tip of my knife pulling&nbsp;
the meat away with my food hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.640
following the rib structure&nbsp;
putting my knife underneath

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.200
and I've removed one of the loins turning it over&nbsp;
you can see there is some silver skin which would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.320
be removed and then i'll remove the other&nbsp;
side again what you can use this for is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.200
emus, super tender meat you can also use&nbsp;
it as part of your saddle stuffing in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160
just layering laying out on&nbsp;
your saddle before rolling

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.680
turning it around

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.480
following the spine again I am removing off the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.840
loin pulling the meat with my food hand away from&nbsp;
the bone structure putting my knife underneath

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.480
and here's the second one, this can&nbsp;
be further chopped down for stock
