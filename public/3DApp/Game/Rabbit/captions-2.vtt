this is a full rabbit, minus the head, inside we&nbsp;
can see the beautiful offal which I will come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.640
to in a second a rabbit is an extremely lean&nbsp;
meat you can see there's an absence of fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.880
it's high in omega-3 fatty acids really good&nbsp;
also known as the sustainable, highly sustainable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.880
other white meat and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.080
opening up the cavity taking out the food&nbsp;
inspection stamps suitable for human consumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.920

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.160
in other larger animals, up next working our&nbsp;
way toward the head of the animal into the liver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.760
then closer right inside the rib&nbsp;
cavity is the heart and the lungs

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840
these can be further used in the&nbsp;
stuffing of the saddle of the rabbit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.640
it's a great way to add flavor back&nbsp;
into the rabbit through a farce
