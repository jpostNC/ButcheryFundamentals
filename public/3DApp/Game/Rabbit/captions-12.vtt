00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.640
this is a a great image of our rabbit&nbsp;
that has been fully butchered fore legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.560
rack loin, saddle, hind legs, trim meat and bone, fat offal

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.220
heart

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.400
kidneys liver and lungs and just a&nbsp;
little side note here with the hind leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.280
seeing it was very similar to other&nbsp;
four-legged animals and this is the "Aitch" bone

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.120
as you can see this rabbit is very&nbsp;
light in color the meat in general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.400
it's a the other white meat as it's colloquially&nbsp;
known as it's very different although some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.360
may think they're similar, Hare&nbsp;
is a much darker meat and a similar bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840
structure but very different flavor and&nbsp;
very different color of the rabbit meat
