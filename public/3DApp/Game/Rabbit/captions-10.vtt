00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.080
here we have the saddle of rabbit deboned

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.920
completely boneless two loins here belly&nbsp;
flap and of course the two tenderloins this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.400
is exactly the same as what you would find the&nbsp;
loin tenderloin on any other four-legged animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.520
for this purpose putting in I'm thinking it would&nbsp;
be great if we made a farce from the offal and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.000
stuffed it seasoned it and stuffed it rolled it&nbsp;
trust it and what would I use these tenderloins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.680
for, in your butchery if you happen to have&nbsp;
any notches um and tears in your skin then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.000
this could easily fill in those gaps but even&nbsp;
without it's a great spot for them to nestle in

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.520
so if I was going to roast this I would season&nbsp;
it stuff it and roll it and if I roll it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.080
onto itself it's a pinwheel and if I roll it just&nbsp;
with ends meeting then it's circular so we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:16.560
pretend it has a farce in there just to about here&nbsp;
trim off the belly flap stock or rabbit sausage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.840
and it's ready for either trussing or wrapping in&nbsp;
some sort of fat like bacon pancetta or Caul fat
