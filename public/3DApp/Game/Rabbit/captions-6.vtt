00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.240
here we have our rabbit, top side looking down at&nbsp;
the top, uh two  fore legs removed I've changed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.160
position of the rabbit it's easier to work for me&nbsp;
in this position and you can do the same whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.080
feels comfortable to you and that's safe in the&nbsp;
kitchen with your knife handling next step i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.880
going to remove the two  fore hind legs from the&nbsp;
rabbit and very similar to poultry and chicken i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.720
going to pop the hip joints out of their socket so&nbsp;
i'll do one side and then i'll do the other side

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.600
and now I'm ready to remove the legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560
using my knife first I'm just kind&nbsp;
of visualizing it and tracing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.720
going in and following the bone structure this is&nbsp;
the spine here so that's sort of my guide there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.320
the little "Aitch" bone that you might be familiar&nbsp;
with from pork week and just popping it out

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.000
here's one leg removed turn it over and very&nbsp;
similar to poultry it has two bones left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.240
and plus there's the "Aitch" bone in here&nbsp;
or pelvic bone that could be removed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.160
and this is the second hind leg that i'm&nbsp;
going to remove, I just want to turn it over

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.640
to make it work for me and again this&nbsp;
can make it work for you as long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.040
you're working in a safe manner, i&nbsp;
have popped the hip joint here and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280
sorry I want to turn it the other way

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.560
like this sideways, again following and tracing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.680
coming through you can see the loin right here&nbsp;
underneath I'm turning it over following it

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.400
and right through the hip&nbsp;
joint and there's the second leg
