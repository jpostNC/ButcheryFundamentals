00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.600
here we have the center piece or portion of the&nbsp;
rabbit hind legs were here fore legs were here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
of course head was here and what we're left&nbsp;
with now is the rib section and the loin section&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.880
what I'm going to do is separate the two sections&nbsp;
so i'll have the rib and the loin section&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.760
ready for further butchery&nbsp;
looking for the last rib

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.280
and again feel like you trim whatever you need to see&nbsp;
where you're working and where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.280
you want your knife to go so I'm looking I feel&nbsp;
the last rib I place my knife follow that rib&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.400
and then I'm just going to cut through the belly&nbsp;
flap same on this side feeling for the last rib

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.720
and cutting through so how do I get these&nbsp;
two pieces separate from one another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.240
i can just bend it switching my knife&nbsp;
to a heavier gauge knife again and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.720
like so, so just bending the spine and&nbsp;
now exposing it and cutting through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.840
like rib section loin section
