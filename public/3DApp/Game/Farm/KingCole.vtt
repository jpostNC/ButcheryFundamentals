1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.402
So my name is Chris Conzelmann
and I am a fourth generation

2
00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.237
duck farmer here at King Cole Ducks.

3
00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.873
And we grow white Peking Ducks.

4
00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:09.442
So our farming philosophy

5
00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.210
is pretty simple.

6
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.511
We are fully integrated farm.

7
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.512
We do everything from hatchery

8
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.581
and incubation
all the way to processing and packaging.

9
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.918
So honestly, it's quality at every point,
every stage of that

10
00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.322
But I mean, we were a farm to fork before
it was trendy.

11
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.225
So that's really for us,
it's about quality.

12
00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:29.896
So so we grow a white Peking duck
that duck.

13
00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:33.099
It's naturally a flightless bird
domesticated duck

14
00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.635
that creates it's a mild flavor
that comes out of that.

15
00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.838
Honestly,
that's really just the preferred.

16
00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.809
What we found our market has really been
after four for seven for 70 years.

17
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.376
Right.

18
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.047
So again,
we have two different strains that we run.

19
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.151
One is a King cole strain,
which is about a 50/50 split between

20
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:56.423
breast and breast meat and fat cap,
as well as a Cherry Valley strain,

21
00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.426
which runs about 75%
breast meat to fat cap.

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.129
And we just put either strain
into different markets that we have.

23
00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:04.497
Fat is flavor.

24
00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.766
I mean, through it, through it anywhere.

25
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.836
But for us, the fat cap is that fatty

26
00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.139
or duck is typically used in the Chinese
Peking style cooking.

27
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.975
That's where you going
to get the really nice crispy skin

28
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.211
and you're going to
spend time rendering it out.

29
00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.715
For us, a less fat cap is just more of a

30
00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.751
I'm going to we're going to call it
an easy duck to cook.

31
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.988
But but again,
if if you ever have the choice

32
00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.592
that fatty duck is 100%
our personal favorite.

33
00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:33.993
Yeah, absolutely.

34
00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.764
So our day starts by picking eggs by hand
we pick 12,000 eggs a day.

35
00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.967
We've we've grown over the years
to that size.

36
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.704
From there,
the eggs get taken to a separate farm

37
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.408
where they're put in, they're gone
through a candling process.

38
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.612
They're washed and graded
and then they get set in incubators

39
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.615
for 28 days after the 28 days comes out.

40
00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:59.052
We now have quacking ducklings
and they get placed back into a barn

41
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.456
and throughout that process they get,
they get set into

42
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.693
where they have feed lines, water lines,
much like what you can see right behind us

43
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.397
at that point
we also have a processing facility as well

44
00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.468
where we do all of our breakdown of the
birds from whole ducks, breast, legs

45
00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.772
And then in Mississauga,
we even have a cook plant, so we take it

46
00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.508
one step further.

47
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.110
So every aspect
of every aspect of the duck.

48
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.081
So in Mississauga we do we have a cook,
we have Smokehouse, we've got Sous-vide,

49
00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.750
we do a bunch of different
cooks through there.

50
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.886
And that's a federal facility as well.

51
00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:33.186
Yeah.

52
00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:36.823
So so it's a combination of a it's
a corn soy and wheat.

53
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.926
There's a bit of molasses mixed in there,
but it is done in a pellet form.

54
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.927
Yeah.

55
00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.930
So again, that was something that,
that we, you know, it's,

56
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.498
it's, it's all about quality.

57
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.568
So we make sure that we go through
we've got a team of,

58
00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.571
we've got a team full time on that
just make sure that their feed is

59
00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:53.706
flies on the farm.

60
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.275
Right. Who would've thought.

61
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:59.345
But but yeah, honestly,
it's just about quality at that point.

62
00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.983
But I absolutely love just a pan
seared breast done to that medium rare.

63
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.921
I find that it's like if I can,
if I can get anybody to try it, then there

64
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.623
they,
they almost swap from steak at that point.

65
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.091
Yeah, absolutely.

66
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.495
I mean again, I mean I have to touch back
on that four generations

67
00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.331
of excellence that we've been pushing
all the way through.

68
00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:23.403
You know, we, we it starts with it
starts with our waste philosophy

69
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:27.240
that we have next to no waste
when it comes to we we wash and dry

70
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.208
all of our feathers.

71
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.312
For example, as a waste product goes
into down duvets and things like that.

72
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.847
We have a recycling plant that creates

73
00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:39.452
that takes 95% of our water
and puts it back into cycle

74
00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.788
so we can do it for wash downs
and things like this.

75
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.824
We have a composting facility
which takes all of our litter

76
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.528
and duck manure and compost's it,
and we sell it into the market and

77
00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.330
as soil blends.

78
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.098
So I mean, that's just one aspect of it.

79
00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.133
There is virtually
no waste across the board

80
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:58.171
and when it comes down to a duck,
every part of the duck from tongue's

81
00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.739
all the way to gizzards and feet.

82
00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.875
And like I said, there is
there's, there's a spot for it.

83
00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.478
So so we're very proud on that side.

84
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.248
And the other side
is that we work every single day

85
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.417
just to make sure that, again, quality,
quality, quality.

86
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:12.719
That's really what we're pushing

87
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.722
I'm Chris from King Cole Ducks.

88
00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.223
And you've got to try the duck!
