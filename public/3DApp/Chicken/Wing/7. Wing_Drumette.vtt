00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.469
So here we have the chicken breast.

2
00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:08.608
And here we took the wing off

3
00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.012
to French this bone

4
00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.250
here we have a little bit of the extra
meat on the wing.

5
00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.953
And this was the wind tip that we removed.

6
00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.491
So there's two bones in this wing

7
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.061
and we'd like to remove the small bone
and keep the big bone.

8
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.498
The way we're going to do
that is by using our French knife

9
00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.135
and holding it with our thumb,
our index finger wrapping, our other hand

10
00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.771
fingers around with our non cutting hand.

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.973
We're going to hold down the wing.

12
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.008
We're going to push the knife

13
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.778
close to the edge as possible
to the heel of the knife.

14
00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.715
Put our non cutting
hand on top and push down.

15
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:52.185
And I'm

16
00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.955
going to show you the two bones
right here.

17
00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.192
I like to hold that up
and just with my fingers,

18
00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.896
I pull or push the meat down.

19
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.834
And you can see that the two bones

20
00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:11.037
that we talked about earlier are exposed.

21
00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.741
We have the small bone and the big bone.

22
00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.410
The small bone is
the one that we want to take out.

23
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.547
So you want to push down
and then you want to pop it out

24
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.517
and hopefully it comes out
without breaking.

25
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.453
This is a nice, clean bone.

26
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.587
You don't need that anymore.

27
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.323
You can put that for stock here.

28
00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:34.928
I always like to keep my area
nice and clean and organized.

29
00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:39.265
Now, chicken does carry salmonella
in its natural flora.

30
00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.170
That's
why when we're going to use any equipment

31
00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:47.907
we like to clean and sanitize it
before we put it away,

32
00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.810
and that includes your knives
and your side towels.

33
00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:55.515
So for example, if I took this towel
and I want to clean the bone a little bit

34
00:01:55.915 --> 00:02:00.320
with my towel, I cannot use this towel
to wipe up my kitchen.

35
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.055
I would use another

36
00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.757
clean towel.

37
00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.561
And this
is what is known as a chicken lollypop.
