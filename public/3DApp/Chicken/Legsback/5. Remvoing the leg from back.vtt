00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.836
So right here I have the back,

2
00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.472
thigh and leg all attached,

3
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.076
and I'm going to separate the thigh
and the leg from the back.

4
00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.846
What I like to do first,
I make a small incision

5
00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.416
in the middle of the back
and I have to find where the oyster sits.

6
00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:21.688
I can use the tip of my knife to get into
that bone pocket on both sides.

7
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.958
Once I get into the bone pocket,
I put my knife down

8
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.294
and I can use my actual finger to dig out

9
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.698
the oyster that's in that bone pocket

10
00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.368
and show you where those oysters sit.

11
00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:40.407
Right in those bone pockets
right there, so it's very important

12
00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.477
that you harvest those because it's
the tenderest part of the leg.

13
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.614
So right now, I don't need my knife.

14
00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:54.454
I can just use my hands and you can see
if I hold firmly with my non cutting hand

15
00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.390
and with my cutting hand

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.193
This bends quite easily
because there's the hip joint.

17
00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:04.097
What I can do is when I hold it,
I'm going to pop it out the other way

18
00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:08.902
and then the hip joint
or the femur comes out of the joint.

19
00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.039
And all you have to do here
is just cut on a slight angle

20
00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:21.314
to remove the leg and thigh,
and we're going to do the exact same thing

21
00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.050
on the other side so I can hold it firmly

22
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.188
and I'm going to pop it out.

23
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.091
And you can see
comes out of the hip joint.

24
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.695
Take your knife cut on a slight angle
towards the back

25
00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.101
and here you have your leg and thigh.

26
00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.771
And here
you have your other leg and thigh.

27
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.506
And this is the back.

28
00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.209
And here is
where the two oysters were sitting.
