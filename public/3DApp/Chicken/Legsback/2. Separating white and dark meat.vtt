00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.102
Talk a
little bit about the anatomy of the bird.

2
00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.771
And here we have a whole chicken.

3
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.673
These are the wingtips.

4
00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:11.211
We call these the flats
and this part is the drum of the wing.

5
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.381
Here we have the breasts.

6
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.817
And if I turn it to the side,
you can see here

7
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.889
we have the thigh and the leg,
the back of the chicken.

8
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.961
You can see the little neck exposed here
and two little nodules that pop up.

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.230
Those are called oysters.

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.532
And they're the tenderest part of the leg
muscle.

11
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.902
Now for me to separate

12
00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.904
the white meat from the dark meat

13
00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:41.841
or the breasts from the legs,
I have to make a small incision.

14
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.310
Right at the back above the oyster.

15
00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:47.580
I'd like to then

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.118
pick up the bird to stretch the skin,
and I line up that cut

17
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.990
with the skin that I'm stretching
and I draw my knife right across

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.293
so I can cut and separate that part

19
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.430
by not cutting any of the breast meat.

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.034
I like to do the same thing
on the other side, where I line up

21
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.938
the same cut here, stretching the skin

22
00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.576
and cutting along here,
so I don't cut any of the breast meat.

23
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.215
And that's just lining it up,

24
00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.716
just like that.

25
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.653
So here.

26
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.356
I almost have it all separated.

27
00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.460
What I like to do now
is just crack and twist,

28
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.630
and I have in my one
hand the leg and thigh.

29
00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:42.535
And on the other hand,
the breast also known as the crown.
