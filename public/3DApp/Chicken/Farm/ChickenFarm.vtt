00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.604
Name is
Dave Fennema and I raise commercial

2
00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.075
broilers and some pigs and some cows,
but on a very small scale,

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.145
the name of the farm is Spencer Creek Farm

4
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.581
and are closely associated
with Fenwood farms.

5
00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.684
I think one of my

6
00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.121
major philosophies is - is I just try
to guide everything along without.

7
00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.325
Trying to force anything

8
00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.028
because everything has a balance

9
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.032
I try to connect all the circles,
all the all the loose ends,

10
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.068
so I try to make sure
that everything I produce is used.

11
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.740
For example, I have in my barns, my
chickens, I produce chickens, my brothers,

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.010
my main meat is my main product,
but I also produce manure as a byproduct.

13
00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:44.744
Right.

14
00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.547
So I will sell that manure to
other farmers that use it on their fields.

15
00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:48.815
Right.

16
00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.851
And I have cattle here
which graze all my land,

17
00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.688
which is not very useful for crops
because it's too hilly and too swampy,

18
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.325
and they eat up my leftover chicken feed
if I if I have any.

19
00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.560
Same with my pigs.

20
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.729
So I try to close all the circles.

21
00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.265
The birds that I raise are
there are from a commercial line,

22
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.634
so I raise a commercial bird.

23
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.736
It's a Ross Ross

24
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.037
Bird,

25
00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.841
which is the Ross is the breed and

26
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.079
It takes about 42 days,
I get them as day old chicks

27
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.848
and at the end of 42 days,
they weigh approximately

28
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.452
2.7 kilos live weight.

29
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.221
They grow extremely fast.

30
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.857
Every week I get a shipment of chicks in

31
00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:34.227
and 1/3 of that

32
00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.431
batch of chicks goes into a barn
where I raise antibiotic free birds

33
00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.068
and they're also animal byproduct free

34
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.805
so in a commercial operation,

35
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.576
the feed will typically
contain a meat protein.

36
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.847
And which is the animal byproduct
after it's been rendered,

37
00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.016
and so in our antibiotic

38
00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.353
free program and our animal byproduct
free program, there's no meat protein.

39
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.525
So they get their protein from soy meal
instead of meat.

40
00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.730
And then one that the other two thirds
goes into our organic stream

41
00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.900
and the organic stream is

42
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.602
raised to a higher standard.

43
00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:19.172
All the feed has to be certified organic,

44
00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.876
which means that the grains
are not genetically modified.

45
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.411
The grains have never been sprayed.

46
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.515
They've been raised in fields that have

47
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.416
crop rotation program implemented.

48
00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:36.256
Whereas my antibiotic free program,

49
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:40.260
the grains are commercial
so I'm using, they have, I think

50
00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.263
they could be genetically modified,
they could be sprayed.

51
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.130
Right.

52
00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.734
So the organic strain is a higher

53
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.670
quality of product,

54
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.840
but it's
also more difficult to raise. Yes.

55
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.777
And that cost reflects the organic grain
which are more expensive

56
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.213
because it's more labor intensive
to produce organic grain

57
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.818
in a commercial crop

58
00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.522
grain crop you can spray your fields,
whereas organic crop

59
00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.692
you actually have to physically
till down the weeds,

60
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.995
and your production
is a little bit lower in organics

61
00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:19.766
because you have more weed competition
and you don't always have

62
00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:24.170
the commercial fertilizers
to to synthetically pop up your yields.

63
00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:29.075
There's also more labor involved in
the actual raising of the organic birds.

64
00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.479
So the standards say that I have to have

65
00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:37.283
it's 21 kilograms per of bird

66
00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.521
per square metre
which is my density levels for organics.

67
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:46.025
With my ABF products, my antibiotic
free birds, I don't have that limitation.

68
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.962
So I have to have more physical
barn space,

69
00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.598
which means I have to use more fuel
to heat the barn.

70
00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.400
I have to use more
shavings to cover the floor.

71
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:55.835
I'm also

72
00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.071
required by organic standards
to let the birds outside.

73
00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:03.109
So that requires that in the mornings
I raise the doors up till I'm outside.

74
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:03.776
In the evening,

75
00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.411
I lower them again,
so I have to go in the barn

76
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.680
more often, sometimes
have to physically chase them in.

77
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.514
Right.

78
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.385
So the higher prices do they reflect the

79
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.722
the different level of energy production

80
00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.758
that goes into the organic product?

81
00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.661
OK, we are John and Carol Fennema.

82
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:25.131
We are the founders and owners of Fernwood
Farm.

83
00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:29.102
And obviously, as my wife, Carol, here

84
00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.139
she I'd like to say

85
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.142
I'm the right hand person,
but no, I'm the left.

86
00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.544
one day decided
we decided that we were going to start

87
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.383
selling free range chicken.

88
00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.686
So we had like 30 birds we put outside,
we had them processed

89
00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:50.757
and then we put one liner or two liner
in the spectator

90
00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:55.328
and we couldn't believe all the
the attention we got.

91
00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:59.299
And we just had them packed on ice
and we had them

92
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.703
out of the foyer of our house
and we thought, Well,

93
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.204
this is this is pretty good.

94
00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.973
And at the same time, when we did these

95
00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.711
days of
sale where we would sell the chickens,

96
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.747
which did grow over the years, like,
I mean, quite substantially,

97
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.750
we used to have open houses,
we used to have hot dogs

98
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.421
and hamburgers, and we used to have hikes
or rides for the kids.

99
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.257
So it was like a bit of a fair here.

100
00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:28.361
And then one day we met somebody who said,
Why don't you try organic farming?

101
00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.831
And we just followed their suggestion,

102
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.434
and he gave us some contacts and away
we went.

103
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.870
Everybody's interested in nutrition.

104
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.174
Everybody wants really good nutrition,
and we feel

105
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.043
that what we're doing is for

106
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.114
everybody just needs to eat
well in order to feel well.

107
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.451
To live well.

108
00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:55.254
And that's been our philosophy
the whole time is just raising

109
00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.123
nutritional goal to be very authentic.

110
00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.559
Only put the best

111
00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.496
products into our chickens
and whatever we do,

112
00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:07.767
and that includes the process
we try to hand process and we

113
00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:11.504
I think we do a better job than any,
you know, really mechanized plant.

114
00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:16.242
What we sell is a product,
but the product is

115
00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.712
for us, the product is hope.

116
00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.948
And I think everybody,

117
00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.218
when they want to buy organic,
they're they're looking at hope.

118
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.186
They're hoping that it's
going to be better for them.

119
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.955
They're hoping it's
going to improve their health.

120
00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:32.992
Now, a lot of times we get people
that are are ill or they've had something,

121
00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.728
and now they're looking
for some alternative.

122
00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.531
And I think organic, the whole

123
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.834
the whole organic industry is
a is a is a product of hope.

124
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.140
Fenwood farm strives to give the customer

125
00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:53.246
the best quality
nutrition that we can grow.
