1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.334
first thing we always want to do

2
00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:04.971
is sanitize our station down,
so got the sanitizer here,

3
00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.341
spray that nice, get some paper towel

4
00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.911
and you really want to vigorously
give this a good wipe down.

5
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.647
This will kill any bacteria
that might be on there.

6
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.784
So before we even start
getting ready to cut any meat or

7
00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:22.589
any type of preparation, we're starting
with a clean and sanitized workstation.

8
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.058
Just going to get a little mat.

9
00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.526
This is a plastic mat.

10
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.596
Sometimes this is bar matting as well
Actually, you might say in the industry,

11
00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.097
you can put glasses that stops

12
00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.666
it slipping
and then I'm going to get my cutting board

13
00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.002
and I put my cutting.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.537
But I always want to check that it's flat.

15
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.974
Sometimes as cutting boards get older,
they sort of bevel a little bit as well.

16
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.443
So you want to make sure
you've got the flatter side

17
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.045
that will go onto that mat.

18
00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.581
And this stops any type of movement
a lot of times in the industry

19
00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.783
or even at college.

20
00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.752
You're not going to be on a wooden board.
You'll actually be on stainless steel.

21
00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:56.656
That stainless steel can make it slip,
so you want to make sure that it is very,

22
00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.291
very secure.

23
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:03.029
Also, in the industry, what you will see
is different color cutting boards.

24
00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.432
These are all used for different
applications.

25
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.667
Brown is used for cooked meat.

26
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.303
Red this one here is used for raw meat.

27
00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.406
Blue raw, raw fish and seafood.

28
00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.276
Green vegetable and fruit preparation.

29
00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:20.080
Yellow is for raw poultry
and you can also get the white one,

30
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.250
which we got here
is used for bakery and dairy product.

31
00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.587
These will be used
to avoid cross-contamination,

32
00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:32.192
so you will never use a red board
like this for any other application.

33
00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.527
Apart from raw meats.
