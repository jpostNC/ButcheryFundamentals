00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:04.771
So this is what's called the beef clod
or beef shoulder clod muscle.

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:10.410
This is the upper shoulder muscle or
upper arm muscle of the animal.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.782
This particular muscle holds up the
the heaviest part of the animal.

4
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.184
And so therefore,
it does an enormous amount of work.

5
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.421
And it's generally associated
with being quite tough.

6
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.991
It is tough, but
it's also wonderfully flavorful.

7
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.729
So one of the beauties of this particular
muscle is that it can be used

8
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.097
in a lot of different fashions.

9
00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:35.702
One, we can we can trim off
some of this silver

10
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.904
skin along the exterior of it.

11
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.711
And this silver skin will,
just even when we're finished cooking it,

12
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.148
it would make the muscles seem
a little unduly tough.

13
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.452
So that is the reason
why we would normally feather this.

14
00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.622
This particular part of the clod off.

15
00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.462
But it's very common
to tie this into a roast

16
00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.099
and then use it as a pot roast as well.

17
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.002
Excellent muscle to cut stew from.

18
00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:14.240
And finally, this is an outstanding
section to put into a grinder.

19
00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:20.180
You'll make some of your most flavorful
burgers, meatballs, sausages

20
00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.483
from muscles that are that have seen

21
00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.419
a lot of work , that you'll get some oats

22
00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:31.157
and some really, really deep flavor
from this particular muscle.
