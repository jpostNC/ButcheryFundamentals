00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.871
Welcome back, everybody, today here
we have a leg and thigh drumstick

2
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.006
and thigh I'm going to show you

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.843
how to debone the thigh,
so actually take that femur bone right out

4
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.013
so you can have a either skinless

5
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.250
or skin on deboned thigh,
which are very popular

6
00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.320
in the supermarkets now.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.756
So here, if you flip it
over on the other side again

8
00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.026
I'm going to show you the fat seam
and again I'm going to use my finger

9
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.695
to find where the exact joint is.

10
00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.331
I'm going to replace the knife

11
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.801
where my finger was,
and I'm just going to cut right through.

12
00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.705
So again, there's no hacking or whacking,
right here

13
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.243
I have a nice drumstick that I can bake,
fry, bread.

14
00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.980
Make fried chicken
out of all that good stuff.

15
00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.718
Here I can identify
where the actual femur is.

16
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.087
I'm going to take my knife on both sides.

17
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.221
And I cut.

18
00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.326
So I can expose that femur.

19
00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.429
Here's the one side.

20
00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.732
Here's the other side.

21
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.001
So what I like to do
is I like to take my fingers

22
00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.571
and try and get underneath just like this.

23
00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.007
So I'm right underneath the bone.

24
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.442
I'm going to remove my finger

25
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.311
and replace it with the knife,
and I'm going to cut up on one side.

26
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:23.883
There are sometimes a little bit
of cartilage and connective tissue.

27
00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.086
Any time you're going around a joint,

28
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.855
you want to make sure
that you get as much of that as possible.

29
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.025
It does have a little bit of a

30
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.861
texture to it if you do not remove it.

31
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:40.967
So here we remove the bone and right here

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.771
we're going to feel with our fingers
if we let any of that cartlidge.

33
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.907
And if we did, we're going to go back
with our knife

34
00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:52.212
and gently remove
any little bits that are still there.

35
00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.953
And this right here is a boneless

36
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.224
with skin on

37
00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.926
thigh.
