00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:04.270
So welcome back here, we have a chicken
Supreme with the skin on.

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.608
And I'm going to show you
how to take the tender off and actually

3
00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.611
re-stuff it back into the breast

4
00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.581
to make it a little more plump and juicy.

5
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.218
So here we have the skin on

6
00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.820
and we can, for this purpose,
take the skin off.

7
00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.124
It's just as easy as just holding it down

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.360
and pulling the skin right off.

9
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.830
And you can keep this skin

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.999
to make a schmaltz.

11
00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.636
Trim that off.

12
00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.908
Well, keep that in my fridge.

13
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:49.582
So if you look at the actual breast
at the moment,

14
00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.153
you'll see a thick part here
and a thin part here.

15
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:58.758
And if you look at the actual chicken
tenderloin, you'll see the same thing.

16
00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:01.995
If you look closely,
there's a thick part and a thin part.

17
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.232
So what I like to do is I take my knife
and I'm going to make an incision

18
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.768
in the back end where the bone starts

19
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.771
and I want to create a pocket.

20
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.842
So just make a small incision
and with your knife carefully.

21
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:16.943
Don't try.

22
00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:20.413
Don't poke out of the flesh
that defeats the purpose.

23
00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.583
And once you create that pocket,

24
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.689
you are going to take this chicken tender
and you're going to put it in the pocket.

25
00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.224
So this is the thick part.

26
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.828
It's going to go to the thin part,
and the thin part here will go to

27
00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:35.862
the thick part here.

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.373
There's a little pocket that I made.

29
00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.846
And I'm going to open up the pocket,

30
00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.250
and I'm going to put that right in.

31
00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.556
And we'd like to close it up,

32
00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:08.461
and of course, you can use other things
other than the tender, you can use

33
00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:12.232
spinach and ricotta,
you can use some pine nuts and cream

34
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.101
cheese or any other kind of stuffing
that you might

35
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.871
think about to add.

36
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.671
But there you go.

37
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.274
You have a nice, plump, juicy breast.

38
00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:25.945
And you actually are
using the tenderloin as well.
