00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.168
Welcome to the fundamentals of butchery.

2
00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.571
Today we're going to take you through
some poultry techniques.

3
00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:09.542
My name is chef Chris
Loizou and I work at George Brown College.

4
00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.980
So here
we have the wings and the wing tips.

5
00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.316
We have the breasts.

6
00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.619
If I turn it to the side,
you can see the thigh

7
00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.988
and the leg, the back of the chicken.

8
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.691
Here is the back and the neck.

9
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.261
And these two little nodules,
they are known as the oyster.

10
00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.731
If we flip the bird around,

11
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:37.570
we like to push the legs into the breast
so it'll plump up.

12
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.706
And we do this for a couple of reasons.

13
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.977
When we're going to trust it,
we trust it to promote

14
00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.580
even cooking and to keep its shape
when we take it out of the oven.

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.384
So before I do that,
I like to let the bird stand up straight

16
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.686
when I'm going to actually roast it.

17
00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.891
The way I do that is I take the wing tip
and I flip it over to create a V pattern.

18
00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.996
I do the same thing on the other side.

19
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.967
This will help it sit up straight

20
00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:12.038
and again just gently
push the legs into the breasts.

21
00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.974
This is your end goal.

22
00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.976
You're going to take some twine

23
00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.412
and you're going to put it
under the bum of the chicken.

24
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.782
And just like you do your laces,
you make sure that they're even

25
00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.885
you're going to take one

26
00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.688
part of the string and flip it over
and the other

27
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.225
you flip it over the other knuckle
to create like an eight

28
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.830
figure eight and you're going to sort of
push it together.

29
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.833
And you have to be tight,

30
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.769
your other part here
is this guy go underneath to hold out one

31
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.237
wing down and the other string

32
00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.539
is going to go on the other side
to hold the other wing down.

33
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.274
And here the neck.

34
00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:52.812
We're going to tie it like once
- the way we tie her shoe and then twice

35
00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.416
and we're going to pull and when we pull,
this will plump up the breast

36
00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.120
and then we're just going to tie
a knot and get rid of the excess string.

37
00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.991
And this is how we
truss a bird ready to roast.
