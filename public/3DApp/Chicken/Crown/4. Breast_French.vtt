00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.003
So here we have a chicken supreme

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.905
with the drumette and the flat attached.

3
00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.743
And if I flip it over,
you will see that here

4
00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.045
we have the chicken tenderloin.

5
00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.715
And if I follow that seam, I can separate

6
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.218
the chicken tenderloin from the breast.

7
00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.988
About doing so,
I can use this for other purposes,

8
00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.157
they can skewer this, I can grill it.

9
00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.460
I can also make the famous chicken
finger with that.

10
00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.897
Here you're going to find
a little bit of subcutaneous fat.

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.968
I like to trim off as well just to make it
I can make it look nice

12
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.838
in my display case in the butcher shop.

13
00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.244
So here I have the breasts,

14
00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.214
and this is where it is
attached, I'm going to move over about

15
00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.452
a half a centimeter
and I'm going to cut all the way around

16
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.188
and I can feel the bone with my knife.

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.324
I put my knife down

18
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.094
and I'm going to separate this meat
with my fingers.

19
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.964
Bring it all the way back
so you can expose the bone.

20
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.102
This bone actually bends easy one way.

21
00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.139
But what I'm going to do is hold it
firm with my left hand and with my right

22
00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.576
hand, I'm going to pop it
the other way to remove this

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.712
and this extra meat is on the flap,

24
00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.084
which I'm going to put on my tray.

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.521
Here we have a little bit of the knuckle,
and with my French knife,

26
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.258
I'm going to trim that slightly.

27
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.762
Hold the knife with your thumb
and your index finger

28
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.964
and your other fingers
wrapped around the handle.

29
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.333
You're going to get as close

30
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.271
to the end of the knuckle as possible
and close to the end of the knife,

31
00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.574
and then you're going
to put some pressure on the top.

32
00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:51.244
And you notice with my non cutting or non
holding hand, it's

33
00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.980
well away from the knife,
so it doesn't slip.

34
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.081
And if it does slip,

35
00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.184
it's preventing from cutting myself.

36
00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.587
So I'm going to push down

37
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.624
and I'm just going to take a little tip
off, and that's going to make it look nice

38
00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.894
and it's
for cooking and esthetic purposes.

39
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.997
And we can also charge more
when we trim it up, like that.
