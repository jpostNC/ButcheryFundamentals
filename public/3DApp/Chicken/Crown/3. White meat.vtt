00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:04.404
Now we are going to separate the bresats
from this crown.

2
00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.606
If you look at it

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.943
inside the bird,
you're going to see the keel bone.

4
00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.245
You're going to see some rib bones

5
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.549
as well as if I flip it over,
you will not see,

6
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.953
but you'll know in here
there is the wishbone.

7
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.189
What I like to do

8
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.794
when I start is I like to find
where the joint is on the wing, tip

9
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:32.599
with my finger, replace
my finger with the knife

10
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.469
and just cut right through the joint
so I can take the wing tip right off.

11
00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:40.306
I like to do the same thing
on the other side, so again, I'm feeling

12
00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.577
my way to the actual joint, replacing

13
00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:50.050
my finger with the knife
and taking the wing tip off.

14
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.987
So now I'm left with
the drumette and the flat.

15
00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.824
So in order for me to take

16
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.694
one of the breasts off the keel bone,

17
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.933
I need to use the whole knife
and being careful

18
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:11.704
not to put so much pressure as to, I'm
going to break right through the bones.

19
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:16.109
This is a very delicate bird,
so I like to use the whole knife,

20
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.346
make an incision
as close as possible to the keel.

21
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.349
And if I open it up,

22
00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.320
you're going to be able
to see where the keel bone is.

23
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.925
I can feel the knife
touching the keel bone.

24
00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:38.731
So my knife is an extension of my hand
as well as my non-cutting hand

25
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:44.904
is used to spread the meat
so I can follow the ribs along.

26
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.875
And that's going to expose the wishbone,

27
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:54.147
where I also follow the wishbone
along to the shoulder joint

28
00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.784
and then I cut through the j- shoulder
joint.

29
00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.220
And then I have a

30
00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.126
supreme with the wing still attached.

31
00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.431
I'm going to do the same process

32
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.601
on the other side using the whole knife,

33
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.872
putting my knife on the actual bird,

34
00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.574
cutting down.

35
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.579
Putting my knife back feeling
where the keel bone,

36
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.916
I can feel it with the knife
and I'm going to twist the knife.

37
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.853
Follow the ribs, and with my non

38
00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.656
cutting hand, I will open that up.

39
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.760
Find where the wishbone is

40
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.530
cut right down until I get to the joint

41
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.633
and then just cut right through the joint.

42
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.469
And this will be another

43
00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.938
Supreme with the wing

44
00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:56.676
still on. Here

45
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.114
you will see the keel bone
we discussed and the ribs.

46
00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.983
And on the other side, the same thing.

47
00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.152
And if I look here, we'll find some meat

48
00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.522
that is underneath the actual

49
00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.126
wishbone,

50
00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.962
I like to harvest that meat off

51
00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.031
so I can use it for other products.

52
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.767
So here is the wishbone.

53
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.102
Here is the keel bone. Here are the ribs.
