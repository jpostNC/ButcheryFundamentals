<p>
    Fresh poultry is extremely perishable. <br>
    Because it has such a short shelf-life it should arrive well chilled, ideally at 32ºF (0ºC) and kept well chilled until used. <br>
    Ideally, use poultry within 24 hours of receiving. <br>
    Do not store in the fridge for more than 4 days.<br>
    Poultry often carries salmonella bacteria. <br>
    Wash and sanitize all equipment and cutting surfaces after handling poultry to avoid cross contamination with other foods. <br>
    <b>Freezing: </b> <br>
    Store frozen poultry at 0ºF (-18ºC) or lower until it is ready to thaw. <br>
    Thaw in its original wrapper in the refrigerator. <br>
    Allow 1 to 2 days for chickens to dethaw in the refrigerator.<br>
    Allow 2 to 4 days for larger birds to dethaw in the refrigerator.<br>
    If pressed for time, thaw in cold, running water in original wrapper <br>
    <b>Do not refreeze thawed poultry </b>
