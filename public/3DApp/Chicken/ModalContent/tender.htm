<p>The tenderness of a piece of poultry is related to the type of muscle, the amount of connective tissue, and age of the bird. The older a bird gets the more connective tissue develops and the tougher the meat becomes. <br>
Connective tissue also increases with use or exercise of the muscle <br>
The older an animal gets and the more a muscle is used the more flavour it develops.<br>
The tenderest cuts tend to be the least flavourful.<br>
On poultry- the white meat- the breast, tenderloin and the drumette are the most tender.<br>
The dark meat- The leg and wing are tougher but have more flavour.<br>
