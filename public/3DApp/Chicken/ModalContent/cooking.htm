<p>Young, tender birds like broilers, fryers and cornish hens are usually cooked by dry-heat methods, such as grilling,
    broiling, frying, and roasting.</p>
<p>Older, tougher birds need slow, moist heat to be made palatable such as stewing, poaching or braising <br>
    Low temp roasting is best for larger birds, such as turkeys & capons
</p>
<p>Chicken and turkey should be cooked to internal temperatures of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whole bird- 180ยบ (82ยบ C)</li>
    <li>Pieces 165ยบ F (74ยบC)</li>
</ul>
