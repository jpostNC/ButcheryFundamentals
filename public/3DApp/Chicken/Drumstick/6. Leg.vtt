1
00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.371
So here we have the leg.

2
00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.340
And typically in a supermarket,

3
00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.145
if you're going to go and buy a leg,
you might find it with the back attached.

4
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.881
For our purposes, we took the back off.

5
00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.318
But I want to show you
what you might find in the supermarket.

6
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:23.323
This right here is just the same leg,
but we just split the back right in half.

7
00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.992
And here the back is attached,

8
00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.529
so you still have some of the bone,
which is great for stocks.

9
00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.699
But in our purposes, we took the back off.

10
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.870
So here is one leg with the thigh

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.906
and the drumstick
still attached that you can find a retail

12
00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.474
supermarket.

13
00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.746
Here we have it for our purposes,
we took the leg off.

14
00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.315
I'm going to show you the other side.

15
00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.683
Remove the skin, not remove

16
00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:54.220
the skin, but just move the skin over
so I can show you that fat seam.

17
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.723
And I want to find where the joint is.

18
00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.590
So I put my finger

19
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.127
right on the joint and I can feel it
moving up and down or back and forth.

20
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.131
I'm going to take my French knife
and you notice my French knives are nice

21
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.965
and clean.

22
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.101
And I always like to have water
close to me.

23
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.405
Maybe a cloth, put my knife down
wipe it properly.

24
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.574
So I'm not going to hurt myself.

25
00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.477
Hold the knife with my thumb
and my index finger

26
00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.448
using my non cutting hand
feel where the bone is.

27
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:26.152
Replace my finger with the knife
and just cut right through

28
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.356
so I can get that drumstick off the thigh.

29
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.565
Here is
the thigh and here is the drumstick.

30
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.034
I like to trim a little bit of the knuckle
right off.

31
00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.605
And that is the same process

32
00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.276
holding the knife,
getting close to the end of the knife.

33
00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.913
Using your non cutting hand
so you don't slip.

34
00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.317
Put it on top and just cut straight down.

35
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.390
And now you have your drum

36
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.392
and your thigh

37
00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.795
removed, ready for cooking,

38
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.031
grilling, frying, any other method.
