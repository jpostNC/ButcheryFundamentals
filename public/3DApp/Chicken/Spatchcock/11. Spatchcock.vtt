00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.338
OK, so the next thing is going to be
spatchcock or butterfly chicken,

2
00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:11.311
which is excellent for even cooking
and as well as reducing the time

3
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.947
that you're going to be grilling
this, this, bird, right,

4
00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.851
as well for marinades.

5
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.287
You know, you have more flexibility
to add more flavors into it.

6
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.590
But anyways, let's go through.

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.492
So we have our breasts once again?

8
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.961
Breast, legs, thighs,
everything looks very pretty.

9
00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:32.632
I usually start with the neck towards me,
I identify where the neck is,

10
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:37.137
and with my scissors or shears, I'm
going to cut right next to the neck.

11
00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.306
I'm following the line of the neck
all the way to the back.

12
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.310
And then I'll do the same on

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.880
the other side. OK.

14
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.320
Now, at this point,
I'm almost done with the butterflying,

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.992
but if you can see this, the
the the breasts still up.

16
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.996
And what I want is to make this flats OK,
so how are you going to do that

17
00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:06.466
very carefully, I'm just going to,
you see, very carefully here.

18
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.601
There's almost like a triangle.

19
00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.371
What I'm doing here is just,
I'm getting to the keel.

20
00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.108
Just so it opens up a little bit.

21
00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.778
Just like that,
now that I opened the keel,

22
00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.513
I don't need to remove this part off.

23
00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.082
You can just keep it like that.

24
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.984
Will these having the bones
like this as well will prevent

25
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.121
a drying of the meat
while you are grilling it?

26
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.825
So here you have a very simple technique.

27
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:36.496
Very fast, very easy
way of butterflying the the chicken

28
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.100
once again it's called spatchcock
or butterfly chicken.
