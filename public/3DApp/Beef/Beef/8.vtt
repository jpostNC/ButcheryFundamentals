00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.640
so now what we're going to take off is&nbsp;
the rest of this "Aitch" bone or this hip bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.000
with this hip bone it is going to be connected in&nbsp;
a ball and socket joint with the femur bone so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.960
socket will be in the hip bone and half of the the&nbsp;
femur will have a ball right inside that socket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.960
and there is a very strong tendon inside that ball&nbsp;
and socket joint that is holding this together

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.280
so my first step is to loosen&nbsp;
the first inch of this hip bone

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.960
so we can start getting underneath it&nbsp;
it's very important when you're boning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.360
as you can tell my grip you'll see it will often&nbsp;
change with my boning knife in this case here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.360
a lot of the pressure I'm putting on my the face&nbsp;
of my knife towards the bone and that's how I stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.840
very close to this particular bone now if my knife&nbsp;
slips it's very dangerous because it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.520
be coming straight for me traditionally what&nbsp;
what butchers will do is they will take a steel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.560
and they will put it inside this hip bone there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:25.840
a hole right here and this is how I remove&nbsp;
my fingers from this particular situation

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:39.840
there is my ball and socket joint

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.680
now that I'm down to this&nbsp;
point I can remove my steel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.480
because my fingers are going to be clearly out&nbsp;
of the way and I'm going to continue to follow

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.160
these bones all the way up

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.292
there is our hip bone
