00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.800
so this is what's called the beef clod or beef&nbsp;
shoulder clod muscle this is the upper shoulder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.640
muscle or upper arm muscle of the animal&nbsp;
this particular muscle holds up the the heaviest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.200
part of the animal and so therefore it does&nbsp;
an enormous amount of work and it's generally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.320
associated with being quite tough it is tough&nbsp;
but it's also wonderfully flavorful so one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.000
the beauties of this particular muscle is that it&nbsp;
can be used in a lot of different fashions one we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.480
can we can trim off some of the silver skin along&nbsp;
the exterior of it and this silver skin will just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.800
even when we're finished cooking it it would&nbsp;
make the muscle seem a little unduly tough so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.840
it's that is the reason why we would normally&nbsp;
feather this this particular part of the clod off

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.720
but it's very common to tie this into a roast&nbsp;
and then use it as a pot roast as well it's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.160
excellent muscle to cut stew from and finally this&nbsp;
is an outstanding section to put into a grinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.160
you'll make some of your most flavorful&nbsp;
burgers, meatballs, sausages from muscles that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.560
that have seen a lot of work that's when&nbsp;
you'll get some really really deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.724
flavor from this particular muscle
