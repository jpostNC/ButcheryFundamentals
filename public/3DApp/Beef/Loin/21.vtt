00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.000
i'm gonna cut for you a porterhouse steak&nbsp;
using my hacksaw how I like to do this

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.840
traditionally as a butcher i&nbsp;
would cut these using a bandsaw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.720
but for the magic of your video I am going to&nbsp;
do this using my knife and a hacksaw I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.520
to get my knife right in between those vertebrae&nbsp;
and I wouldn't suggest doing this at home if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.720
don't have any experience because knowing where&nbsp;
that vertebrae is does take a bit of expertise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.840
now that i've made that initial cut I'm going&nbsp;
to take my hacksaw and I'm just going to cut

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.840
i'm just going to cut through that&nbsp;
vertebrae and now finish the cut

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.828
and this is a porterhouse steak
