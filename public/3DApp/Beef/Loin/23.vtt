00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.480
all right so I'm going to remove this tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.960
and now what we're going to do is we're going to&nbsp;
remove this vertebrae from the strip loin itself

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.280
there is one bone in our strip line&nbsp;
this is our 13th rib bone, sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.480
not one bone there's one rib bone in&nbsp;
our short loin and this is the 13th rib

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.200
and this is our d-bone striploin now&nbsp;
traditionally when one would order a striploin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.240
this would have a lot of fat cap and a lot of&nbsp;
restaurants would not prefer to have as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.160
backpack because a lot of it will just go directly&nbsp;
into the garbage so when you see a striploin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.400
you'll often hear people referring to 2&nbsp;
numbers that would be placed before the word&nbsp;striploin

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.120
and so often one of the most popular ways&nbsp;
to order a striploin is by saying something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.640
zero by one and zero by one is referring&nbsp;
to the thickness of both this tail region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.560
so how much of this tail you want to leave on&nbsp;
your tenderloin and the quantity of fat cap so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000
if we wish to cut this down further

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.600
that will trim back my my tail from here now&nbsp;
we are ready to start cutting some steakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.360
traditionally most butchers will cut a steak&nbsp;
from a striploin fat cap up now one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.800
the great way reasons why we would do this is&nbsp;
this way I can measure out my steaks so assuming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.360
that I want to cut all my steaks at approximately&nbsp;
one inch first thing I will do is I will square up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.560
my striploin and then I'm going to make&nbsp;
a little mark in the actual fat itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.160
so I can measure out all my steaks&nbsp;
now that I have my my markers down

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.948
I can start cutting my steaks
