00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.680
okay so this is a fully prepped tenderloin and&nbsp;
now now a chef would have multitude of options&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.440
to to play with this let's just talk about&nbsp;
the nomenclature of this tenderloin as as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.160
whole piece um so this piece here the fattest part&nbsp;
traditionally this is known as the chateaubriand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.440
and this is that piece that I was&nbsp;
describing where the pieces have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.320
ears now traditionally this would either&nbsp;
be tied to be held together as a roast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.760
or in the case where you're just selling&nbsp;
steaks some will even square off some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.400
of these ears to make it one uniform piece&nbsp;
this center piece of the beef tenderloin

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.280
is what is known as the most&nbsp;
prized piece of tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.040
and it is often referred to as the&nbsp;
tornadoes this particular muscle would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.840
be traditionally where we would cut our pure&nbsp;
steaks and so that would just be a matter of

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.800
this third piece which is the&nbsp;
tail end of our tenderloin is often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.640
referred to as the filet mignon and&nbsp;
it basically means the minuscule piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.560
and so this particular piece would either&nbsp;
be taken off and sent to a different kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.840
or what we could do is we could tie it&nbsp;
and turn it into equally sized pieces
