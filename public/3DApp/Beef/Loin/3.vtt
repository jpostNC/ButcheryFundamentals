00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.160
in this video I'm going to show you how to&nbsp;
tie a butcher's knot we're going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
our chateaubriand end of the tenderloin or&nbsp;
our butt end of the tenderloin to tie this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.680
knot and what this is going to do it's going to&nbsp;
hold the ears of the tenderloin tightly towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.360
the center so we get a nice tight package I
like to when I do these knots I like to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.920
my twine below me so either in the pocket of my&nbsp;
apron or I will put it in a food safe container&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.080
in my workstation below me&nbsp;
i'm going to pull my twine up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.560
and I'm going to tug my twine just underneath&nbsp;
whatever it is that I'm going to be trusting

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.480
I like to start in the middle because as I push in&nbsp;
it's going to push everything into both directions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.760
i'll then tug my twine back and forth to make sure&nbsp;
that it is it is going straight oftentimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.040
what happens or what you don't see when I'm doing&nbsp;
this quickly is I'm doing this to prevent bunching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.200
of my twine underneath the tenderloin I'm going&nbsp;
to take my twine over and around the tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320
and then I'm going to put it over top of my hand&nbsp;
as you can see my fingers are making the letter c

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.720
and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to&nbsp;
twist my wrist so I can come and grab this twine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.040
and make a loop and I'm going to take this&nbsp;
individual loose end of the twine and put it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.320
into that loop I'm now going to pull that tight&nbsp;
and now essentially what I have is a slip knot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.120
and I can position the slip knot wherever it is&nbsp;
i like and I could pull it as tightly as I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.560
so choose my final step is to commit this&nbsp;
knot with a second knot and this just prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.160
my slip knot from coming undone I'm going to&nbsp;
cut off the excess twine and there you have it
