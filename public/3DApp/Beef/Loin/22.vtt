00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.400
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going&nbsp;
to remove the tenderloin from this vertebrae&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.320
so we're going to take my knife and I'm going&nbsp;
to run the face of the tip of my knife along

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.920 I 
the top part of this vertebrae

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.480
and I'm going to be putting pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.840
onto the bone and allow that bone to&nbsp;
guide my knife all the way through

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.240
once i've made it this far in a lot of because&nbsp;
this is such a tender region of the animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.840
i can really just use my fingers to&nbsp;
separate out the rest of this tenderloin

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200
and that's just how naturally&nbsp;
tender this particular region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.400
is there is a lot of connective tissue holding it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.240
all together so there is our tenderloin on&nbsp;
the side here we have a chain and I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.424
remove out that chain and&nbsp;
take off some of this membrane

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.040
now just do it tidy up some of this elastin

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.240
this region that is tapering so much this&nbsp;
is often referred to as the filet mignon

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:52.720
and a big chunk of the tournedo was removed when&nbsp;
i cut that one quarter house so I only have about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.426
another one or two pieces of porterhouse&nbsp;
left on this section of the tenderloin
