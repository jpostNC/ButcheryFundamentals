Hi my name is Dave Melly, I am a teacher here&nbsp;at george brown college i've been a butcher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.680
for the last 15 years of my life I used to&nbsp;
be one of the partners of a company called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.960
the healthy butcher and today we're going to&nbsp;
be butchering some beef and some veal

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.840
what I&nbsp;got in front of me is a beef tenderloin 
this is a whole beef tenderloin fat removed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.080
and on this end here&nbsp;
this is the butt end of the tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.360
as we move into the middle, this middle section&nbsp;
is known as our Tournedos and then

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.320
this is our tail end of our beef tenderloin and&nbsp;
it tapers to get skinnier first thing I'm going&nbsp;to do

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.200
to do when I start butchering the beef tenderloin&nbsp;
is I'm going to remove what's called the chain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.880
the chain is just a piece of meat right here&nbsp;
usually while I take the chain I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:57.840
start to remove the first layer of membrane&nbsp;
that would be surrounding the beef tenderloin

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.160
the chain will end right where what we call one&nbsp;
of the ears of the tenderloin so this butt end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.520
of the tenderloin has got these two larger&nbsp;
pieces on the side they're often referred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.800
as ears those are colloquial terms but they&nbsp;
make a lot more sense once you see the whole

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.080
all right so now my chain is removed next thing&nbsp;
i'm going to do is I'm going to finish removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:39.840
the membrane from the from the&nbsp;
exterior of this tenderloin

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.080
the silver skin acts a lot like&nbsp;
the singeing of a rope so it will hold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.280
the muscle fibers&nbsp;
together and if you don't remove them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
all it'll make this particular muscle appear&nbsp;
to be tougher than it actually is so proper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.840
butchery of this is paramount because a lot&nbsp;
of the value in the beef tenderloin is simply

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.740
you
