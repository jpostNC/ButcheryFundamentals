00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.760
so this section here is referred to as a short&nbsp;
loin for many of you might be asking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.560
question well if this is a short loin what's&nbsp;
a long loin? a long loin would have this the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.760
sirloin or the top sirloin attached to this so if&nbsp;
i had a top sirloin here this whole thing would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.200
referred to as a long loin with the top sirloin&nbsp;
removed this is referred to just as a short loin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.000
it is made up of two major muscle groups we have&nbsp;
our tenderloin and then underneath it we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.560
our striploin and they are connected with&nbsp;
with half of the spine vertebrae right here

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.280
where the tenderloin is the fattest this&nbsp;
particular region is referred to as the tournedo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.600
region of the tenderloin this particular&nbsp;
region of our short loin if I were to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.560
steaks from it these steaks&nbsp;
would be referred to as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.880
porterhouse steaks where the tenderloin&nbsp;
is a medium size but starting to taper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.000
these particular steaks if I were to cut steaks&nbsp;
from it would be referred to as just t-bone steaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.720
and where the tenderloin is now is not there&nbsp;
these would be referred to as either bone-in striploins&nbsp;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:30.582
or wing steaks so we have a wing steak a&nbsp;
t-bone steak and then we have a porterhouse steak
