00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
so to go from one side to the other in&nbsp;
terms of what we have on display here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.920
this is our inside round or our top round this&nbsp;
would traditionally be used for veal cutlets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.320
we have our sirloin tip or our sirloin&nbsp;
tip knuckle this is our top sirloin

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.880
this was our shank&nbsp;
steak also known as ossobuco&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.400
this is the outside round or the bottom round&nbsp;
right next to it is the eye of round and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.800
we pulled this off the two of them were connected&nbsp;
and we called that the gooseneck but when they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.600
separated like this this is the bottom round or&nbsp;
the outside round and this is the eye of round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
this was that piece of tenderloin or the tenderloin&nbsp;
butt also referred to as the chateaubriand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.640
this was the femur bone, this was the flank, 
these three muscles were pulled off together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.640
they came off of the edge of our shank and we&nbsp;
refer to this as the heel meat i've separated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.240
these three muscles so we can see that we&nbsp;
have one piece here which is referred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.160
as the rat's tail, we have another muscle that's&nbsp;
been completely cleaned up and this is referred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.040
as a merlot steak traditionally you would&nbsp;
only cut this from beef but I decided this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.760
was a good time to show you where it comes&nbsp;
from this was that spider steak that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.160
had shown you before and this came out of our&nbsp;
hip bone it's also referred to as oyster meat

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.720
finally this pile of meat that you see behind all of these muscles this is what we call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.160
trim so these are just uh in the process&nbsp;
of manicuring all these muscles we produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.840
this pile of offcuts that we would put into a&nbsp;
grinder and we would use these to make meatballs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.261
sausages or some type of forcemeat with it
