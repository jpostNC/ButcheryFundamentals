00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.360
okay what we've got here are a lot of the&nbsp;
pieces of a carcass of beef over let's start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.040
from left we'll move to my right on this side&nbsp;
of the of the animal this is our hip of beef&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.640
in this case this is a hip a veal this would be&nbsp;
about 40% smaller than what a fully grown beef&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.240
would have but all the components are almost&nbsp;
exactly the same the major difference here is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.480
particular processor left the sirloin on the hip&nbsp;
whereas if I were to get a hip of beef the sirloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
region would be removed so it would actually&nbsp;
only be up to about this point right in front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.960
of it this is a beef sirloin so when we actually&nbsp;
get to cutting this down we're going to compare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.600
these two sirloins to see the size difference&nbsp;
next we have what's called the short loin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.040
so this short line is where we would cut t-bones&nbsp;
we will get into this particular muscle but what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.880
is missing from here will be our bottom sirloin&nbsp;
region which is more or less the abdominal region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.800
of the carcass then we have our rib a rib&nbsp;
section is exactly how it describes its ribs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.840
four through twelve and this is we would cut a&nbsp;
variation of various rib cuts finally we have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.520
section from the shoulder this particular section&nbsp;
from the shoulder is called the clod region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.400
and this is what would be considered the upper&nbsp;
arm of the beef or the upper part of the shoulder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.440
directly now what's important about understanding&nbsp;
and the reason why we've laid them out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.400
this way is simply so we can start to understand&nbsp;
where these muscles are going to be coming from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.560
and understanding where the muscles come from&nbsp;
is the beginning of the understanding of whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.880
or not the muscle is part of either a locomotive&nbsp;
muscle or it's a supportive muscle and what I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.800
by that is if the muscle is part of the process&nbsp;
that helps the animal move or a muscle that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.960
constantly in use that means that those muscles&nbsp;
are constantly being worked they're constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.760
getting food brought to them and they're getting&nbsp;
oxygen brought to them so those muscles will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.960
stronger in flavor but what it also means is that&nbsp;
the actual muscle fibers themselves will be larger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.720
more engorged and they will be tougher there&nbsp;
will be more collagen formed between the fibers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.240
themselves to help those fibers work together if&nbsp;
they are supportive muscles so muscles from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.160
mid region this mid region would often for human&nbsp;
standpoint we would refer to this as our core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.520
these core muscles on a four-legged animal&nbsp;
aren't doing a lot of work you don't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.040
beef in the fields doing sit-ups or doing&nbsp;
a downward dog very often and so because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.480
that these muscles don't get that same exercise&nbsp;
they don't get the same amount of feed and oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.840
flowing through the muscles so they're going to&nbsp;
be less flavorful but a lot more naturally tender
