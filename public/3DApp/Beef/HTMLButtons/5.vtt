00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.080
all right so what we're going to do is we're&nbsp;
going to start working on this center region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.040
known as the short loin but before we do let's&nbsp;
just talk about how these muscles uh flow into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.920
each other so the shoulder is removed that would&nbsp;
be ribs one two three and four at least in Canada&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.960
our rib section would be ribs&nbsp;
1 or 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.560
and then the 13th rib would be on our&nbsp;
short loin now traditionally what would happen at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.680
a processing plant after the animal is is&nbsp;
bled out and then we uh we eviscerate it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.680
the next process would be the process of grading&nbsp;
and grading would happen where they would actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.560
make a cut between the 12th and 13th rib while&nbsp;
the carcass is hanging so they can see into

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.880
they can they can peer into&nbsp;
this loin muscle right here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.960
and what they're going to do is now they're&nbsp;
going to take a card and they're going to grade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.920
the quantity of fat cap and the amount of&nbsp;
intramuscular marbling and that's how they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.280
will determine whether or not this particular&nbsp;
muscle is getting a "B", "A", "AA", "AAA" or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.400
prime grading and this is all gonna be based&nbsp;
on the color of the fat the color of the muscle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.760
and the size of the fat cap and the and the&nbsp;
quantity of intramuscular fat marbling from there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.000
the sirloin this is where our tenderloin&nbsp;
will start and so this is the tail end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.800
our tenderloin and as we move along the vertebrae&nbsp;
this tenderloin is gradually going to get bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:51.520
two-thirds of our tenderloin is in the short-loin&nbsp;
region once we get into this part of the sirloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.240
the rest of the tenderloin is sitting&nbsp;
on top of the sirloin so you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
two-thirds of your tenderloin sitting on top of&nbsp;
the short loin and one-third of your tenderloin or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.920
the chateaubriand end of your tenderloin sitting&nbsp;
on top of your beef sirloin and that is right here
