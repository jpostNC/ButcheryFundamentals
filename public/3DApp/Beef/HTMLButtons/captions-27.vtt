00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.040
so here we've got a good display of very common&nbsp;
uh cuts that we would be ordering in a restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.800
so I'm going to go from one side to another and&nbsp;
just talk about them quickly, up front we've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.400
a couple of veal chops these are veal rib chops&nbsp;
these are lovely steaks that you would pan sear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.760
and give them a light braise what we've got are&nbsp;
two different types of veal so we have the pro-v&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.360
medial and we have some grass-fed red veal right&nbsp;
behind it this isn't a grilling steak so on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
this board everything else being grilling steak&nbsp;
this one this this is a piece of ostobuco from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.360
the shank and this is a beautiful braising uh&nbsp;
braising cut especially as we get into the fall on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.040
the winter it's an absolutely delicious thing to&nbsp;
serve here we have our tenderloins and we have i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.960
just wanted to show you the difference between&nbsp;
the veal tenderloin and the beef tenderloin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.200
these are both tornado steaks so as you can tell&nbsp;
this steak is about half the diameter of our full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.320
beef and you can see quite a difference in the&nbsp;
color even though this is some of the red veal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.480
it's still significantly lighter in&nbsp;
color than the beef and even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.480
you know this is slightly darker than&nbsp;
what we would have had as provini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.840
back here we have a nice display of our&nbsp;
sirloin so this is that full sirloin steak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.520
where we have the cap and then the the baseball&nbsp;
and the heart all as one particular stake this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.840
our sirloin heart our sirloin butt steak next to&nbsp;
it is our baseball steak or sirloin baseball steak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.320
and then this is a cap steak with which we left&nbsp;
the fat cap on but this could we could easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.080
trim that down so this this is a nice variety&nbsp;
of sirloin options now we're getting into our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.280
strip line and here we have an example of both&nbsp;
triple a and double a and if we look at these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.320
gratings next to these rib eyes you could tell&nbsp;
these ribeyes here are single a versus a double&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.040
and a triple a and so what we're comparing is just&nbsp;
the inter-muscular marbling in the three muscles

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.560
here we have a rib eye proper this is a boneless&nbsp;
rib and the difference between the two is simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.720
whether or not this tail and fat nugget is left on&nbsp;
the the end of it and then right next to these we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.160
have two different types of prime rib steaks one&nbsp;
of them is a wet aged rib steak and the other one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.160
is a dry aged drip steak and as you can tell the&nbsp;
wet age is just slightly bigger and our dry age is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.000
just a little bit tighter and we can see some of&nbsp;
that some of the dark discoloring there but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.080
would be the simple difference between those&nbsp;
two and over here we have a porterhouse steak
