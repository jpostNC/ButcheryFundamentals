<p><b><span class="bblue">Connective tissue:</span></b> Connects the skeletal muscles to the bones, it also gives structure to other tissues or organs in the body. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Marbling:</span></b> intramuscular fat in muscle, the high presence of marbling is used as a quality indicator in beef </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Primal Cuts or Primals:</span></b> When an animal is divided in primal sections. These are the primary cuts butchers make. Primal cuts are further broken down into sub-primal cuts, and retail or fabricated cuts like steaks or roasts. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Sub primal cuts:</span></b> The secondary cut into a primal after it has has been removed, top round would be a sub-primal cut.
</p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Wet Aging:</span></b> Sub primal cuts are vacuumed, sealed and allowed to age without access to oxygen. Moisture loss is controlled by this process and is therefore a more economical form of aging to allow enzymes to break down connective tissue and make the muscle more tender. Iron flavours develop the longer beef ages in a bag. </p>
