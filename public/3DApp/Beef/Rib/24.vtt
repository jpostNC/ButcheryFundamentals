00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.280
so now we're getting into our rib section and&nbsp;
we're going to use this opportunity to talk

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.000
about a couple really exciting things when it&nbsp;
comes to beef and their grading and different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.280
aging programs so the first thing let's talk&nbsp;
about is grading so oftentimes you hear about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.120
different letters of the alphabet like "B" "A", "AA", "AAA" and Prime &nbsp;
double a triple a and prime and we want to fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.720
understand what these all mean well here we've got&nbsp;
a nice cross section because this particular piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.680
of rib is graded "AAA" and&nbsp;
some of the components to this particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.720
"AAA" will be the fat cap the color of the&nbsp;
muscle the muscle texture itself but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.120
the inter-muscular marbling we&nbsp;
can see these ribbons of fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.320
that go within this muscle itself this these&nbsp;
ribbons are what we call intramuscular marbling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.920
the rib section that's right next to it this is&nbsp;
what's considered a "AA" and if when we look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.880
at the particular face of the muscle you can see&nbsp;
that the ribbons of fat are significantly smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.000
and so because they're so much smaller that&nbsp;
this one would have been graded a "AA"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.200
whereas this one would have&nbsp;
gotten a stamp of a "AAA"

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.080
the next thing we're going to talk about&nbsp;
when we we talk about these two particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.080
ribs is that one of them is dry aged and the other&nbsp;
one is wet aged now all beef gets aged a minimum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.640
of 10 days and this is simply to allow the enzymes&nbsp;
that exist within the muscle itself to naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.720
break down connective tissue and in Canada&nbsp;
our general standard is a minimum of 10 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.280
if you were to eat a steak cut from here&nbsp;
even given that all things were equal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.400
what it ate the life that it had if you were to&nbsp;
cut a steak pre-10 days the steak will appear to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.720
be significantly tougher than if you were to wait&nbsp;
a minimum of 10 days how we let that animal age or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.240
how we allow that time to pass is gonna be&nbsp;
the difference between what's called wet age&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:25.680
versus dry age so when we dry age something after&nbsp;
the animal has been slaughtered it will hang in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.960
refrigerator for a period of time when it just&nbsp;
hangs like that in a refrigerated setting that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.360
is referred to as dry aging this particular&nbsp;
section of beef has been dry aged for 40 days

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.240
conversely this particular muscle or this&nbsp;
particular rib has been wet aged for 40 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.680
and so wet aging so the day that this animal&nbsp;
was slaughtered that very same day the animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.040
would have been butchered or break and broken&nbsp;
down into its respective parts these muscles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.000
were then vacuum sealed and they were stored on&nbsp;
a shelf under vacuum seal and plastic why would

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.640
we do dry age versus wet age even though it's&nbsp;
significantly more expensive it's simply because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.040
you get a couple of major properties one you&nbsp;
get a denser more protein-rich flavor and two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.160
you get a bacterial bloom around it so in this&nbsp;
case that bacterial bloom has been carved off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.480
but that bloom will often give the meat a lot&nbsp;
of really amazing new components to flavor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.120
these flavors things like butter popcorn and&nbsp;
mushroom are things that people often talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.640
with a wet age the longer it sits&nbsp;
in a bag what ends up happening is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.640
the longer it sits under vacuum you get a&nbsp;
more pronounced iron flavor um in some cases it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.720
you know you can pass it off but sometimes it can&nbsp;
almost taste a little bit gamey or almost livery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.336
so that's a major difference between&nbsp;
the two different aging programs
