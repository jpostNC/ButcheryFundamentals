00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.360
so this is a primal and this is referred to as a&nbsp;
beef rib right now this beef rib has its cap on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.800
we have our back ribs the back ribs are the&nbsp;
ribs that are closest to the spine itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.960
we know they're back ribs because of that&nbsp;
curve so as it reaches the the ribs they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.120
this particular part of the&nbsp;
bone becomes a lot more curved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.520
in this case this the way this rib came&nbsp;
to me came chined which means that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.200
major part of the spinal vertebrae&nbsp;
has been removed with a band saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.640
above these bones would be what's called the plate&nbsp;
and in this plate region would be our braising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.920
ribs but they are not there what I'm going to&nbsp;
do first is I'm going to remove this top set of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.840
muscle and fat because this is this is referred&nbsp;
to as our rib cap and so by removing it i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.440
going to create what's called the capless rib&nbsp;
this would traditionally be the very first step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.440
with the manufacturing of a rib and it's simply&nbsp;
because even if I wanted to tie a fat cap back on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.440
I would want to trim down some of this fat or some&nbsp;
of the muscle that would exist here this region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.000
now is referred to as a capless rib and this is&nbsp;
for obvious reasons I have removed the caps from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.720
it from here I can cut one of my very first steaks&nbsp;
which or a roast which is a capless rib steak

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.840
just like so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:53.840
now I'm going to come to the other side&nbsp;
keeping my knife along these bones

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:17.200
this section of bones known as our back ribs or&nbsp;
beef back ribs and now this muscle here as I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.920
left the tail on is referred to as boneless rib&nbsp;
okay so when the tail is left on the main muscle

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.080
this is what's referred to as a boneless rib steak

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.920
if I remove the tail

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.360
then this muscle&nbsp;
changes its name once again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:57.936
and it goes from a boneless&nbsp;
rib to a boneless rib eye
