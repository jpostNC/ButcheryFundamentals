<p>The Canadian Cattlemen's Association states that Canada is the 11th largest beef producer in the world and the 3rd largest high quality beef exporter. The Environmental Working Group’s Meat Eater report has stated that beef creates 27 kilos of greenhouse gas emissions. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association counter argues that “Canadian beef has one of the lowest GHG footprints per unit of production in the world at 11.4 kg CO2 equivalent per kilogram of live weight, less than half of the world average.”
</p>

<p>There are several arguments against beef consumption. From an environmental /sustainability standpoint; beef production requires 30% of all arable land in the world; methane emitted from cows contribute to over 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions; beef farming uses 15,000 litres of water for 1 kilo of edible meat. 
    </p>

<p>Activists also contest that cows should eat grass nature intended and not grains. This can affect the saturated fat content of the meat.</p>

<p>From a health perspective there are conflicting points, however nutritionally speaking, beef is a complete protein. </p>
