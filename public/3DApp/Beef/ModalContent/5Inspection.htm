<p>In Canada, all meat is inspected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Inspection America is done by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p>

<p>While inspection is mandatory, grading is optional.  There are 13 grades in Canada, though only 4 are common for retail purposes: Prime, AAA, AA, A. With prime being the highest grade. Canada and the USA use grading systems that are mostly similar with some minor differences. Beef in Canada is graded on the prevalence of intramuscular fat in the muscle. This fat is known as Marbling.</p>

<p><b>Marbling:</b> intramuscular fat in muscle, used to grade beef. Marbling is connected to a diet of grain being fed to beef cattle. Grass fed beef do not have the same amount of marbling as grain fed beef so are not graded the same way.
