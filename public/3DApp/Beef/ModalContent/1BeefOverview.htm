<p>Beef cattle are not native to North America and were brought here by French settlers. Bison, or Buffalo, however are native to north America and have very similar muscle structure.
</p>

<p>Beef Cattle are raised conventionally in a variety of ways. </p>
    
<p>Typically, calves are born on specialized farms that have the right equipment and indoor conditions for birthing.  Young calves are nurtured by their mothers for one month and then moved to a nursery until they are 3 months old.
    </p>

<p>3-month-old calves are sold at auction to Finishing Farms whose role is to bring the animals to market weight <b>1000-1250 lbs (600kg)</b>, typically around 18 months of age.
</p>

<p>CAFO's are <i>Concentrated Animal Feedlot Operations</i> where thousands of head of cattle are raised quickly and near one another. This practice makes relatively cheap beef protein available in abundance. Most cattle raised are finished on grain for 2-months before being harvested for meat. </p>

<p>Modern cattle are used for meat, dairy, leather, fuel and for farm labour.
</p>

<p><b>Bull </b> A mature beef male used for breeding is called a bull

<p><b>Heifer: </b> A mature female used for breeding is called a heifer.
</p>

<p><b>Steer </b> A desexed male that will not be used for offspring is called a steer.
</p>

<p><b>Calf:</b> a baby cow. Heifers deliver one calf per gestation, a period that takes 9 months.
</p>
