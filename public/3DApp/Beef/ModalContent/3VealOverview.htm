<p><b>Veal</b> is the by-product of the dairy industry.  For dairy farmers that sell milk for a living, calves that are born male have traditionally been seen as a burden. Veal are young male dairy calves that have been fed milk or fresh pasture and are slaughtered around 6 months.
</p>

<p>Veal meat is prized for being tender and sweet.  The colour of the meat is a paler form of red than traditional beef, but when raised properly should be darker than pork.</p>

<p><b>PROVIMI</b> veal stands for Proteins, Vitamins and Minerals. Provimi veal is raised indoors on a liquid diet supplement created to replicate the benefits of motherâ€™s milk.  Provimi veal are not necessarily young male dairy calves, and Provimi veal does exist as a byproduct of the dairy industry
