<p>Beef differs from other animals in that itâ€™s meat can be aged for weeks and even months without rotting. There is a difference between aged meat and old meat. Aging is done in one of 2 controlled ways.</p>

<p><b>Dry Aging-</b>A process of allowing the natural enzymes to break down connective tissue in beef to make it more tender and flavourful. Dry aging is expensive due to moisture loss. Primal cuts are usually dry aged. Dry aging is considered more flavourful than wet aging. Temperatures and humidity is controlled to ensure food safety. </p>

<p><b>Wet Aging-</b>Sub primal cuts are vacuum sealed and allowed to age without access to oxygen. Moisture loss is controlled by this process and is therefore a more economical form of aging to allow enzymes to break down connective tissue and make the muscle more tender. </p>
