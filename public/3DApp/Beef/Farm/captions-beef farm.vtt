00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.680
my farming philosophy, I carry it&nbsp;
on from my parents but the most natural way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.120
is the best way, I'm a firm believer&nbsp;
in that and I think we run into a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.720
situations where people say well you have a sick&nbsp;
animal do you not treat it you just leave it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.200
pass and that's not the case our animals get&nbsp;
treated all equally the same whether they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.280
an antibiotic or they don't but we would like to&nbsp;
raise animals in a way that the stress is so low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.920
the environment is healthy the feed is great&nbsp;
and and they're living off the land which

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.040
should decrease the level of stress and sickness&nbsp;
therefore creating a very natural product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.920
so I would say our philosophy is a natural&nbsp;
organic way, yeah to give it yeah to give the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.040
animals the best chance of a healthy life and&nbsp;
instead of using medicine as kind of a fallback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.000
we're trying to avoid that at all costs, what often&nbsp;
comes up in family discussions with outsiders is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.640
the fact we see ourselves as real animal lovers&nbsp;
and which is a bit of a contradiction in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
of some people because they see us as being you&nbsp;
know because we're in the meat business therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.920
we must have a very unique relationship with the&nbsp;
animals we raise but I would say we love animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.720
as much as anybody and we do pretty well all the&nbsp;
cattle work here on the farm is done on horseback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.280
we've got dogs and cats as you've seen when you&nbsp;
arrived here, the pigs we really enjoy raising them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.640
all summer long we just really enjoy being around&nbsp;
live animals so it's a it's interesting to think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.800
that you're in the meat business and yet we&nbsp;
consider ourselves real animal lovers, yeah here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.120
it's mostly angus but a lot of the herds you'll&nbsp;
see have a mix so Angus, herford is a big one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.160
some charolais, simmental but we try to always&nbsp;
keep it at least 50% angus and that helps us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.240
actually create a carcass that's pretty uniform&nbsp;
throughout all the brands so angus genetics is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.480
it's definitely the the main one, yeah for&nbsp;
sure. yeah grass-fed is as simple as it sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.920
so through the summer months when the grass&nbsp;
is on the ground they're eating grass and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.680
that's it I don't feed them anything other than&nbsp;
the summer months other than grass and then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.320
winter time throughout the summer months we are&nbsp;
cutting down pastures with grass and we store&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.840
it into the rounds mills you guys will see around&nbsp;
the property and it's essentially dried grass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.440
so it's stored in a way that preserves&nbsp;
it for them to eat in the winter also known as hay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920
and that's what the grass that animals&nbsp;
would be eating in the winter months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.760
so it's always a grass or a grass forage of&nbsp;
some sort, and the grain the grain-fed animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.560
primarily are barley depending on availability&nbsp;
and whatnot it might be corn sometimes but i'd say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.840
barley makes up the bulk of that and then we'll&nbsp;
also feed them a lot of halage or silage which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.800
fermented grains that give us a little more&nbsp;
bang for our buck in terms of volume the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.520
key thing when when we're finishing animals with&nbsp;
grain is to keep enough forage and roughage in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.880
their diet so that they re they maintain their&nbsp;
the functionality of their rumen and still put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.960
on fat which is really the purpose of finishing&nbsp;
anything with grain so we have a two month window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.760
of calving and generally those animals will be&nbsp;
harvested approximately two years later now we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.200
in the meat business selling meat regularly so&nbsp;
we have to take a two-month window of calving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.320
and have those animals finish in a much broader&nbsp;
so the larger steers tend to finish first and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.320
the smaller heifers tend to finish last so that&nbsp;
kind of creates that expansion but we're generally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.240
looking at about two years so if it's two years&nbsp;since the animal is born to when it's harvested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.800
you factor in 10 months that the mother is&nbsp;
carrying the calf as a fetus you're almost three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.440
years start to finish between when the mother cow&nbsp;
gets bred and her offspring ends up on someone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.560
plate so it's a considerable amount of investment&nbsp;
in time, our average heifer weight is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.240
1300 pounds 1250 to 1300 which is not uncommon&nbsp;
in the angus breed and our steers would be 14&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.840
to 1450 pounds live so the average carcass&nbsp;
weight is sitting right around 800 pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.760
775 to 800 pounds is an optimum carcass size for&nbsp;
what we for cutting up and then serving as meat&nbsp;cuts

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.480
a steer is a castrated male that's not kept&nbsp;
for breeding purposes in which case it would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.680
a bull so all males are born as bulls what Lieschen&nbsp;
will do, well you can maybe explain how that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.800
done, yeah so we'll&nbsp;
castrate the bull calves we'll either do a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.040
bit of both, sometimes we'll do it at the beginning&nbsp;
of when they're born right away so we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.720
get a painkiller and we'll either cut or we'll&nbsp;
band I prefer to cut I find it more humane but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.640
anyone would say anything, and then some&nbsp;
actually if they're born right away and I already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.200
like their body size, their coloring or I think&nbsp;
there's potential especially with who I know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.880
cow is and the bull, I will keep them intact longer&nbsp;
and so now we have a couple still actually intact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.880
and i've been judging them and come weaning&nbsp;
time i'll make the decision whether will i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.080
keep them as a bull or will I cut them and&nbsp;
make them a steer and they'll get finished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.760
and into the program and the reason we do that is&nbsp;
bulls tend to grow very large and temperamentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.160
can be a lot more unpredictable so that's one&nbsp;
thing we don't want to risk out in open fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.640
to have bulls around that aren't there for a&nbsp;
specific purpose for producing, heifers are females&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.040
all females are called heifers&nbsp;
until they've had their first calf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.675
in which case they're commonly called a cow&nbsp;
so you have cows and bulls heifers and steers
