00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.040
to start with what I'm going&nbsp;
to do is I'm going to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.960
this hunk of fat because no&nbsp;
matter what most of our consumers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.920
are not going to want that particular chunk&nbsp;
of fat on either the roast or the steak

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.480
there's also a little tiny muscle just&nbsp;
sitting on top and this particular muscle is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.640
the grains are moving diagonally and it's&nbsp;
not a particularly tender muscle so what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.760
i will do is I will remove it simply because&nbsp;
it will throw off the rest of this sirloin

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.520
now now we have the option where it's not uncommon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.880
to use this as an entire roast and so you&nbsp;
could tie it just like so the other way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.800
that you'll often see this merchandise in a&nbsp;
grocery store is they will cut steaks from it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.840
like so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.520
so this is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.560
a very traditional sirloin steak

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.120
and as you can tell I have a large piece of the&nbsp;
cap here this would be that butt piece and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.040
would be that medallion piece of that baseball&nbsp;
end where I originally had to remove that fat i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.840
going to use that as my seam and this seam will&nbsp;
allow me to open up and remove this cap entirely

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.840
removing the excess fat

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.040
this is what we would traditionally&nbsp;
refer to as the picanha

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.840
from here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.360
we can cut steaks from it and I'm going&nbsp;
to be cutting my steaks against the grain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
and this will make my steaks appear to be a lot&nbsp;
more tender and these steaks are beautiful because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
they're a lot like a striploin steak as you&nbsp;
can tell they got that nice beautiful fat cap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.480
on the outside and we can we can carve that down&nbsp;
if we choose or we can leave that on just as it is
