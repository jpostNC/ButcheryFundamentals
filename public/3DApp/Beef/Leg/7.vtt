00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.720
so now I'm going to go after the butt&nbsp;
end of the tenderloin or my chateaubriand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.520
this muscle is sitting on top of both our hip bone and the last the tail end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.600
of our spinal vertebrae so I'm just going to&nbsp;
follow I'm going to use the face of my knife

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.560
and I'm going to be&nbsp;
feeling the bone with the face of my knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.840
just like so so the face of&nbsp;
my knife glides along the bone

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.560
my less dominant hand is going to be pulling&nbsp;
the muscle but it's very important at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.440
stage that I know exactly where my fingers are&nbsp;
obviously because the amount of effort that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080
required to remove this muscle is the same&nbsp;
amount of effort to remove one of my fingers

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.720
so there is our chateaubriand muscle

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.080
now I'm going to be removing is what's called my&nbsp;
hip bone in beef this has got an old french&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.000
word it's called the "Aitch" bone but it's not the&nbsp;
regular not the letter "H" it's spelled "Aitch"

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.440
the first thing I'm going to do is&nbsp;
remove something called our spider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.960
and our spider is a little muscle that&nbsp;
sits on the inside of this curved bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
it is also referred to as your oyster&nbsp;
meat so I'm going to once again use

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.840
the face of my knife to glide against this bone

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.680
this muscle is a beautiful muscle&nbsp;
it's actually very very tender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.440
but there's not very much on the carcass&nbsp;
which is the reason why we often don't see it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.760
sold or merchandised but it&nbsp;
is a lovely piece of meat
