00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.400
so now we're going to remove what's called&nbsp;
the sirloin tip or the sirloin tip knuckle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
this is the equivalence to your quadriceps&nbsp;
so again I'm going to be taking the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.040
of my knife and I'm going to be running the&nbsp;
face of my knife alongside this femur bone

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.000
and it's going to guide me up to where the&nbsp;
knee is and I'm going to go between the knee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.400
and the patella or the kneecap and the&nbsp;
patella always comes off with sort of like hip

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.400
there is my knee

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:57.840
and right underneath is my patella we'll&nbsp;
get a better view of it in just a moment

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.840
so there's my sirloin tip that&nbsp;
is the patella or the kneecap
