the largest muscle in the entire carcass&nbsp;
it's also referred to as the inside round

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.240
it's called the inside round because it's&nbsp;
on the inside part of the hip of beef

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.600
so because the "Aitch" bone was&nbsp;

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.840
that is how we know it's the&nbsp;
inside region of the beef

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.108
the bone that I'm that you are&nbsp;
