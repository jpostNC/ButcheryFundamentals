00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.200
so now we're going to work with the shank region&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.000
the first thing we're going to do is we're going&nbsp;
to remove a group of muscles known as our heel

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.040
the heel region is often&nbsp;
overlooked in north america but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:29.840
in various parts of the world there are&nbsp;
some very popular muscles inside the heel

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.840
there's our heel

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.600
i'm just going to remove the femur so this&nbsp;
region is a little bit easier to work with

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.160
so it doesn't matter how much&nbsp;
we try to clean an animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.240
as we get close to these leg bones&nbsp;
you're always going to get pools of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.760
blood left over and it's simply because&nbsp;
of what their function is in the body

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.431
so now what we're going to do is we're&nbsp;
going to cut a bone-in steak section&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:25.761
from this shank and these are often&nbsp;
referred to as colloquially we call them ossobuco

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.000
so that particular cross section&nbsp;
would be referred to as ossobuco
