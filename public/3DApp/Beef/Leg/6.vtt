00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.680
okay to start with this particular&nbsp;
piece first thing I want to point out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.800
is this clump of fat normally we talk about the&nbsp;
fat that's on the exterior of the animal but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.840
particular piece of fat is a real gem this&nbsp;
is called "suet" this is traditionally the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.120
cleanest fat so this fat will give off the&nbsp;
least bitter flavor after it's rendered and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.280
so it has a lot of uses in the food world&nbsp;
we would render it and turn it into tallow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.646
or we can just chop it up&nbsp;
and put it into meat pies

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.240
next what we're going to do is remove this muscle&nbsp;
that's kind of flapping on the outside this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.960
is what's known as the flank and this is part&nbsp;
of the veal's abdomen or tummy muscles

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.480
just underneath here is&nbsp;
another muscle that is starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.200
and you can see the seam beautifully, so all of these muscles are part of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.120
region of the animal known as the bottom sirloin&nbsp;
the bottom sirloin is ultimately going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.720
your six pack and beef we would call&nbsp;
this particular muscle a tri-tip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.840
where my knife is cutting is known as the flat&nbsp;
meat and then we've already talked about the flank

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.634
so I'm going to remove the bottom&nbsp;
sirloin and put it off to the side
