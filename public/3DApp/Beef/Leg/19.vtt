00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.200
so next we're going to work on the top&nbsp;
sirloin heart or the top sirloin butt end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.200
this is the largest of the three&nbsp;
muscles now we could use this as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.840
a roast and this makes a beautiful roast&nbsp;
it's approximately three pounds in size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.840
or we can cut steaks from it and very common&nbsp;
to see top sirloin steaks now when I cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.080
when I'm cutting a steak from a large muscle like&nbsp;
this I like to use a large knife this is what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.000
referred to as a steak knife and it's because this&nbsp;
particular knife's angle it gives me an extra inch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.560
within this curvature which improves my overall&nbsp;
cut so when I am cutting I start with my tip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.960
and it just increases the surface area when i'm&nbsp;
making that single slice if you can cut a steak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.240
with a single stroke it'll avoid us getting&nbsp;
what I like to call gills in my steak and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.840
can show you what that looks like quickly but if&nbsp;
you're cutting with a lot of different strokes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.360
what ends up happening is oftentimes it&nbsp;
really comes out in your steak and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.840
something that you want to avoid and this is&nbsp;
why we we like to use these large steak knives

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.840
so here we have our three different steaks or&nbsp;
four different ways of cutting a sirloin steak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.560
we have the cut from the whole muscle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.080
we have the heart steaks, the baseball&nbsp;
and then the cap or the pecanha steaks

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.520
just to show that,
I left the cap quite large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.575
so it's not uncommon to see these merchandised

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.840
with either less cap

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.011
or no cap
