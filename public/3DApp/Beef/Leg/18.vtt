00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.240
so now what we're going to do is work on this&nbsp;top part of the sirloin and we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.200
two parts we have where we're going to cut&nbsp;
medallions often referred to as the baseball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.880
and then we have the butt or the heart&nbsp;
part of our sirloin they're separated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.520
by a seam and I'm just going to tidy up&nbsp;
some of this fat so we can take a look at that seam

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.000
just underneath there is going to be&nbsp;
a seam of elastin, elastin is a type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.800
of protein but it doesn't matter how much&nbsp;
heat you apply to it you won't be breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.800
that elastin down especially not while&nbsp;
grilling so it generally would make

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.920
if I were to cut steaks from here it&nbsp;
would make those steaks unpleasant

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.400
so by separating these two muscles it allows us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.840
to remove that elastin and actually&nbsp;
improve both of these muscles tremendously

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.600
now I'm just going to cut off the&nbsp;
excess fat, this is primarily because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.760
one of the characteristics of&nbsp;
both the baseball and the heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.320
is that they're quite a bit leaner with your cap&nbsp;
steaks or your picanha steaks you're going to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.521
that intramuscular marbling but you won't have&nbsp;
the same quantity of marbling on these two muscles

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.280
these are our baseball stakes and now I'm left&nbsp;
with that heart muscle and this heart muscle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.120
is a beautiful muscle I'm just&nbsp;
going to tidy up a bit of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.840
elastin that we'll have on&nbsp;
left over on the side here
