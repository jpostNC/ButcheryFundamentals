00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:04.783
so now we're going after two muscles&nbsp;
combined

00:00:04.783 --> 00:00:07.440
our eye of round and our outside rounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.434
these two muscles combined are referred to as&nbsp;
the gooseneck

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:15.596
so what I want to do is I want&nbsp;to get underneath

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:17.015
or get in between&nbsp;

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:20.000
the femur bone and this muscle group 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.923
so this is our goose neck

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:22.781
here we have&nbsp;
our outside round and our eye of round
