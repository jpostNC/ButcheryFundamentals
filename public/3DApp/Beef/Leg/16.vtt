00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.720
so here we have a top sirloin this is a primal&nbsp;
muscle as it is and so we're going to be talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
about it from all the different ways that&nbsp;
we can work with it this is one of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.840
versatile muscles uh within the beef and&nbsp;
so because of that a lot of chefs really prize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.760
it because of so many different functions that it&nbsp;
has, now it's made up of three main muscles if i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.920
were to tell you the equivalent on your body this&nbsp;
is essentially the gluteus maximus and minimus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.720
of the animal, so to&nbsp;
take a look at what these muscles are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.760
on the bottom we have what's called the&nbsp;
sirloin cap this sirloin cap in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.800
parts of the world especially in areas that&nbsp;
speak portuguese is referred to as the picanha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.520
then once you remove the cap you have&nbsp;
two main muscles you have what's called either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.800
the butt or the heart and then you have&nbsp;
the baseball which is cut into medallions
