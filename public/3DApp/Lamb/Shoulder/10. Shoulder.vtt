00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.603
Next, we're looking at our lamb shoulder.

2
00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.406
So on our lamb shoulder,
we also have the foreshank.

3
00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.942
First,
that's the thing I'm going to remove.

4
00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.113
So to do that,
going to look for this joint here.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.082
It's a bone. OK.

6
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:20.587
And that's going to be my indicator
on where to start.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.590
So I'm going to stand it on its edge here.

8
00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.358
I'm going to come right down

9
00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.627
above that, right down to the bone

10
00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.831
and score and go all the way around.

11
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.037
So once I'm all the way around.

12
00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.508
I'm going to remove

13
00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.511
these or break these tendons here

14
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.546
up into the arm, if you will.

15
00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.819
It's important to sever

16
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.789
all of these tendons
that are up in here to remove it easily.

17
00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.359
Next, I'm going to apply a
little bit of pressure here.

18
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.398
And that's going to

19
00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.534
free up

20
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.069
My foreshank.

21
00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.672
Now, when we're looking at this foreshank,
there's this

22
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.042
bone inside of here.

23
00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:20.680
So oftentimes that's the reason
why we strip the meat off of this piece

24
00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.383
and usually grind it
for other applications

25
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.286
when we're looking at a lamb
shank on a plate.

26
00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.056
Often it is the hind shank that
we're braising and presenting on a plate.
