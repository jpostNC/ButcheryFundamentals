1
00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:04.070
So we
have removed our bone from our shoulder,

2
00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.509
and I'm going to prepare this
for a shoulder roast.

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.012
A couple of things before I do that.

4
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.948
This one's really important over here
and there's this triangular piece

5
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.884
of fat here inside of it and has a gland.

6
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.853
You can see it here.

7
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.523
OK. A gland like this is one of the things

8
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.193
that contributes to that gamey flavor
that we associate with lamb.

9
00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.295
It's important that we remove it.

10
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.700
It's also important that we remove it
because glands spoil faster than meat.

11
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.736
And if we were to, let's say,
grind this into some meat,

12
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.672
it would not be good for the end result.

13
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.808
So that's what I'm going to start with.

14
00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.244
We're just going to remove
this fairly nice and easy.

15
00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.114
OK. Next up,

16
00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:51.284
I've got this piece with heavy duty
connective tissue.

17
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.288
This is part of the foreshank
it attached to the foreshank.

18
00:00:55.722 --> 00:01:00.060
So I'm just going to kind of come
underneath here and remove that piece.

19
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.663
Likely
this will be pushed into my ground meat,

20
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.766
but I will clean up this silver skin
before I add it to that.

21
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.837
Next,

22
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:14.274
I'm looking for connective tissue,
so I've got a good amount of it over here.

23
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.411
I know that my scapula was connected
right here

24
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.816
and I can see in here that there's
a big ropey piece of connective tissue

25
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.052
and that's what I'm going to start with.

26
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.826
So while we're talking about shoulders,

27
00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:37.397
shoulders are also a great one
to braise a little moist cooking.

28
00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.466
That would be lovely here.

29
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.103
So now I'm just about underneath

30
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.739
and I'm going to do
a nice long stroke here

31
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.576
and remove that.

32
00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.084
And I'm underneath it, pulling

33
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.522
and cutting with that knife long
knife strokes here.

34
00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.525
And look at that connective tissue
that we've removed.

35
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.872
So I'm just looking at the shape of

36
00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:24.077
this I'm also feeling this fat,
so I'm going to thin this fat

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.547
just a little bit before I go further
and I'm also going to remove

38
00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.849
this pink part , which is skin.

39
00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.953
So I've got the shape
that I'm looking for.

40
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.056
This little setup is great.

41
00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.568
At the end there,
I'm just trying to tuck it in with my hand

42
00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:53.006
so that I get a good shape.

43
00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:00.547
And apply
some string to either end of this.

44
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.386
And now I
have a shoulder roast ready for the oven.
