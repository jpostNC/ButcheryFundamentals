00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:03.436
So continuing on

2
00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.939
with the shoulder,
we've removed the foreshank

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.477
before we go a little further, I've got a
little blood clot here, which does happen

4
00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:15.415
just means that that blood hasn't come
out of the animal and it clotted together.

5
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.451
I'm just going to remove
that want to make sure that we remove

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.022
any blood clots we find it can produce
some off flavors in your finished product.

7
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.190
Next.

8
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:29.129
I'm going to start at this bone
here, I'm going to come right down to it.

9
00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.999
This is almost similar to a chicken thigh

10
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.002
in that you're going to see this bone
and then it's going to open up down here.

11
00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.838
So I'm going to come
right down to the bone here

12
00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.775
on the either side.

13
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.415
And start to expose our ball joint here.

14
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.121
Then I'm going to come

15
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.391
straight down the middle of this scapula

16
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.494
for me, I do it this way because

17
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.497
it gives us a good view of what that bone

18
00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.599
looks like before we go any further.

19
00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.570
I also like it
because there's a lot of connective

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.241
tissue on this piece here in my hand,
so it'll give me the opportunity

21
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.743
to clean this up.

22
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:25.685
And now I'm

23
00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.854
going to come underneath
on either side here

24
00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.091
and remove this bone.

25
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.095
So the interesting thing about this
scapula is it has like

26
00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.232
a keel bone underneath there, like a
I call it, sometimes the shark fin.

27
00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.534
So it's a bone underneath here
that's curved.

28
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.738
And as we get into it,
it can pose an issue if you don't

29
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.173
understand the shape of it.

30
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.008
So that's what I'm going to do.

31
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.977
first, I'm going to come underneath

32
00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.147
and I'm starting to feel it here
with my finger.

33
00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.182
Now I'm going to come underneath

34
00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.651
on the opposite side.

35
00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.394
I'm cutting against the bone here,
so I want to make sure that I'm

36
00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.598
keeping as much meat on the
on the meat part

37
00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.235
and separating
as much as I can from the bone.

38
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.025
So there's that scapula part

39
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.897
that we were talking about earlier,
and we're left with a boneless shoulder.
