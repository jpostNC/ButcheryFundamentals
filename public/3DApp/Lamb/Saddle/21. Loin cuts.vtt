1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.402
So here we have our loin.

2
00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.138
OK, we wanted to highlight
this for you guys

3
00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.841
because this is the reason why we did
those two halves earlier.

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.176
So this is the halves
that we've boned out.

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.013
Now you can see
this is where the tenderloin is lying.

6
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.950
That tenderloin lies
right against the spine or chine bone.

7
00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.754
Underneath that we have our loin.

8
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.089
OK, we've boned it all the way out.

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.460
This loin we talked about as well
being a striploin if it was a cow.

10
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.397
The cool thing about that is

11
00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.464
that's what this is.

12
00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.334
It looks a lot like a T-Bone steak
you might have seen,

13
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.238
you know, at the grocery store,
at the butcher's counter.

14
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.939
On one side, we have the striploin.

15
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.509
On the other side, we have the tenderloin.

16
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.911
Now we've done these on the band saw

17
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.082
thought it also be great
to show you how to cut it by hand.

18
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.819
So to do that first,

19
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.788
I'm going to try to aim
for that thickness.

20
00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.990
So I'm going to be right in here

21
00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.392
straight down.

22
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.661
OK, now I'm going to stand it up

23
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.000
and go down as far as I can.

24
00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.702
And I'm going to grab the saw.

25
00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.710
And holding on.

26
00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.684
It's just a little bit there

27
00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.320
and see where I'm at
and I might go just a little further.

28
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:30.723
Simply

29
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:35.261
because I don't want to grab it too
hard to get my cutting board.

30
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.031
So now I'm going to finish.

31
00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.037
With a cleaver,

32
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.208
so it's important when you're cutting
with the saw or with the cleaver

33
00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.078
that we do a little scrape
and make sure that there is no bone chips

34
00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.646
on our final product.

35
00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:58.618
OK. It's nothing worse from a guest
perspective, getting a bone chip.

36
00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.953
So give it a little scrape

37
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.990
and make sure that you're feeling it
with your hands and your fingers

38
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.393
to make sure that your guests
are going to get a piece that's enjoyable.
