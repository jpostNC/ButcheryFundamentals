00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.935
So here's our loin.

2
00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:06.039
We are now boneless
and I'm going to remove this loin.

3
00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.144
And then we're going to do some silver
skin butchery.

4
00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.848
So I'm just going to follow this team
here.

5
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.756
And when we're talking about seam
butchery,

6
00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.859
it's really just like that

7
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.894
once you know where to follow,

8
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.932
you don't have to do much work.

9
00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.135
A little touch with the knife
just to help it along.

10
00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.274
And then what I've got here.

11
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:45.979
Is my loin and my belly.

12
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.718
Now, here's that silver skin
that we're talking about.

13
00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.921
And we want to remove this.

14
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.991
It's tough if you cook it on there,
it gets even tougher.

15
00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.460
It's not edible, must be removed.

16
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.396
Now there's a couple of different ways
to do this.

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.765
The easiest one is to get underneath it

18
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.902
and use a long knife stroke.

19
00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.470
Look at the angle of my knife.

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.407
It's kind of pointing up
towards the ceiling. OK.

21
00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:17.177
And then I'm going to make this
taught in my hand,

22
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.915
and I'm going to do a nice, long,
knife stroke here,

23
00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.052
removing our silver skin
just by getting underneath

24
00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:26.653
of it.

25
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.325
Underneath of it.

26
00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.100
And the angle of your knife
is going to help you here.

27
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.969
You don't want to be cutting down
towards the meat.

28
00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.939
OK, nice long, nice strokes help.

29
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:07.527
Clean there?
