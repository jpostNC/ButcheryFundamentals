00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.603
Now I'm going to remove the saddle, so

2
00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.807
my indicator here is this last rib. So.

3
00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.145
Can you hear the difference I'm
tapping on it with the back of my knife?

4
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.281
That's my indicator, here is my last rib.

5
00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.752
I want that last rib attached to the rack.

6
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.454
That's where we're going to make our money
in the restaurant.

7
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.823
It's a little bit
more valuable than this loin cut.

8
00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.493
So what I'm going to do?

9
00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.163
Let's go right against that bone.

10
00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.765
You with me?

11
00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.568
And I'm going to stick my knife through
and I'm going to come all the way up

12
00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.703
to the top.

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.443
I want to switch sides,

14
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.378
so on the opposite side, I'm

15
00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:50.283
going to use that last rib
as my indicator knife through again

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.421
and coming up
following that bone right up.

17
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.791
OK, so

18
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.226
now that I've to lean I'm
just going to lean it off the board,

19
00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.262
I'm just going to.

20
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.732
I'm going to come down to the spine here

21
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.168
just so that I can see.

22
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.404
That's fine.

23
00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.541
Now, when we're doing a cut like this,

24
00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.845
it's important that we're going to find
that joint in the vertebrae.

25
00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.614
Okay, knives are for cutting muscle,

26
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.717
not for cutting bone,
so I'm actually going in between here.

27
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:29.322
If you're not careful,
you could lose a tip of your knife.

28
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.792
So I just want to make sure

29
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.563
there's my spot.

30
00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.769
I'm holding on to the saddle.

31
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.543
I want to make sure this cut is straight

32
00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.113
because it is my rack of lamb
on the opposite side.

33
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.550
And there's that gravity

34
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.186
going to make sure I'm holding on to
it before I cut through here.

35
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.097
And here's our saddle.

36
00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.800
You can see here.

37
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.902
That's that loin. OK.

38
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.270
Nice marbling in here.
