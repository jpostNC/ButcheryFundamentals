00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:04.237
Next up, we're looking at the tenderloins.

2
00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.707
So the tenderloins sit here on either

3
00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:11.011
side of the spine, it's down the middle.

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.580
The interesting thing about
the tenderloins is a lot of times

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.848
when we talk about the tenderloin,

6
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.752
we talk about the head of the tenderloin
and the tail of the tenderloin.

7
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.121
This is the tail of the tenderloin here.

8
00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.391
It's actually closest
to the head of the animal.

9
00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.795
Now, the head of the Tenderloin
is actually buried inside of this

10
00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.632
leg muscle, a little bit closer
to the tail of the animal

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.336
to get in there,
I'm first going to clean this up

12
00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:39.472
so that I can show it to you
a little better.

13
00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.643
So that hipbone is actually here
and comes across.

14
00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:47.180
Up to a point here, you'll start to see it
as I work through this,

15
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.216
so I'm going to go right down the middle.

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.086
So down
the middle of the spine is my first cut.

17
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.193
It's my non-knife hand, you'll notice

18
00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:04.197
that I've been freeing up this meat
so that I don't waste any,

19
00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.434
and I'm just kind of following along here.

20
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.672
If you look at my knife cuts,

21
00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.642
they're long but precise,
so I know where I'm going.

22
00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:20.213
Now this is where it starts
to turn a corner here. So.

23
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.486
That's that belly piece.

24
00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.122
And right, and here's where...

25
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.365
Just going to keep kind
of peeling this part back

26
00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.969
following the line.

27
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.238
Now, this kind of butchery

28
00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.874
that we're doing
is called seam and joint butchery.

29
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.944
So going through
and following the natural seam

30
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.314
between these muscles
to remove that tenderloin.

31
00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.992
So as I mentioned
following that seam right.

32
00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.762
Nice and easy.

33
00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.970
So here is that tenderloin.
