<p>Lamb can be purchased and cooked whole.
    Its wool is used for clothing production and lanolin is derived from its skin to be used in cosmetics.

<p>According to the Environmental Working Group's Meat Eater's Guide Report lamb raised in the US has the highest full lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the emissions at the farmgate while the animal was raised and the processing and transportation after leaving the farm. Arguably sheep only produce 1 or 2 offspring a year and their carczass weight is a lot less than that of beef. Lamb emits 39.2 Kg of CO2 emissions compared to Beef 27 Kg, Pork 11.9 Kg, Salmon 11.1 Kg, Chicken 6.9 Kg.</p>
