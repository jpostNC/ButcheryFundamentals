<p>Peter Sanagan of Sanagan's Meat Locker describes lamb flavour as having  “a unique fresh, grassy, earthy, herbaceous flavour that’s due to a fatty acid that only sheep contain. The flavour of lamb depends hugely on its diet. In New Zealand sheep get a steady- actually pretty much exclusive- diet of grass, and they are prized for their mild grassy flavour. Lamb from the US and Canada can have less of that flavour, as grain finishing is prevalent here in North America.” (Sanagan, 2020)
