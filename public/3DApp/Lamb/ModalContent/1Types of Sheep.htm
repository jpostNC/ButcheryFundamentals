<p>The sheep and lamb we consume today are not native to North America; they were brought here by European settlers as a food source. There are, however, some species of wild mountain sheep that existed here prior to colonization.  </p>
<p><b>Lamb: </b> a sheep under one year of age when slaughtered.  Usually between 4 and 9 months old.    
    Typically in the lambs life cycle, Lambs are born in the spring. This can be manipulated by farmers, forcing lambs to be born year round.

<p><b>Mutton: </b> a sheep older than the one year mark  </p>

<p><b>Ewe: </b> a female sheep used for reproduction. </p>

<p><b>Ram: </b> a Male that has used his reproductive system.  A Weather is a male raised for mutton that has not used his reproductive system.   
</p>

<p><b>Two Tooth: </b> as the temporary teeth fall out and are replaced by permanent ones, the sheep are called by the number of teeth they have. These are usually the first "two" incisors present & is generally an indication of age. 
    A farmer will use the term “yearling” to describe a sheep between 1 and 2 years old.

<b>Breeds </b>
<p>According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) Dorset is the most common breed in Ontario and Canada. Suffolk and Hamshire and RIdeau Arcott are also common. (Kennedy, 2012)</p>
