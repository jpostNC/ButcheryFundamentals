1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.136
Next, I'm going to remove

2
00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.439
the belly or the breast of the lamb here.

3
00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.543
So if you look at the very tip of these
rib bones,

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.813
there's a little bit of cartilage here

5
00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.316
and that spot in between that cartilage

6
00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.119
is cuttable.

7
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.495
So nice and easy,
I'm just going to follow down

8
00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.898
to the middle of the animal here.

9
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.111
The same on the other side

10
00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.781
coming in between that cartilage here.

11
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:54.788
It's fine.

12
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.433
Just stand it up one more time.

13
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.649
So just following that cartilage

14
00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.151
right down to the point here.

15
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.293
And there we have it.
