00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.602
We're
going to remove the legs from this lamb.

2
00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.838
I've got it
hanging off the end of the table

3
00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.208
so that I'm going to use gravity
to help me kind of

4
00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.343
peel the meat away from the bone here.

5
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.980
This is our aitch bone or pelvis. OK.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.483
The tenderloin was sitting in here.

7
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.252
OK, in the top of that bone is right here.

8
00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:24.924
And that you can see even this line of fat
here, the meat comes down here,

9
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:29.162
and that's going to be where
I'm aiming to separate this leg.

10
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.401
Now I'm going to switch
to a dagger grip here,

11
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.604
and I'm going to start to work down

12
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.973
this hip bone.

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.443
Now I'm using just the end of the knife

14
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.478
here to work my way around.

15
00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.782
And now I'm into the ball joint here.

16
00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.517
So this is the ball joint for the leg

17
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.620
and you can see it
kind of where it moves. OK.

18
00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.556
Before I move any further, I'm

19
00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:00.260
going to split my legs into two legs.

20
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.299
Back to that dagger grip.

21
00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.735
I'm just going to follow the structure
of the bone

22
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.335
here.

23
00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.745
So I'm working
very closely against that bone,

24
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.348
so that all the meat that can be on
the muscle

25
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.919
side is on the muscle side, that's what's
going to make sure our portion's great

26
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.422
and my food cost works out too.

27
00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.025
So nice and clean here.

28
00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.029
The other thing when we're doing butchery.

29
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.598
Use your non-knife
hand to figure out where you are.

30
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.767
Is there a bone there? Sure, there is.

31
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.003
I can feel it so that I know
that I've got to trace around it.

32
00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.907
Finished that knife cut through.

33
00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:02.255
And there you have.

34
00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.559
Lamb leg.

35
00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.096
So you can see it's nice and straight.

36
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.464
We've got the end of it.

37
00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.800
And that fat cap was
right against the tail here.
