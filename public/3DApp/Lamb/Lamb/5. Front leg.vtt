00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.303
Now we're going to remove the shoulders,
shoulders

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.539
on any animal, they work very hard.

3
00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.776
These are the muscles that are used
to propel the animal forward.

4
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.745
If you think about any of these animals,

5
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.546
they're eating grass,
so they're bending down,

6
00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.883
using those shoulders to get down lower
and have access to that.

7
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.620
So the other thing
that's interesting about shoulders

8
00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.924
is that there's not really that much
holding them onto the carcass here.

9
00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:29.562
So I usually start by trying
to create a cavity. OK.

10
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.300
And then I try to visualize that line,
so I want it round like this?

11
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.804
Have a nice, round swooping
line seem to come up,

12
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:42.175
as I mentioned to this line earlier. So.

13
00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.582
Nice and easy.

14
00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.851
And I just try to visualize here

15
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.854
where I'm going,
and I'm almost free already.

16
00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.967
You can see in here.

17
00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.570
This is the back of the scapula here.

18
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.675
And when I'm doing this, this is that seam
butchery that I'm talking about.

19
00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.412
So when I do this,
I shouldn't see incisions.

20
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.949
See, I went a little deep here,
but I should see it nice and clean.

21
00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.253
And that's how you know you're doing it
effectively.

22
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.103
I'm just going to leave it
right on the table

23
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.004
and finish that cut.

24
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.076
So there's my shoulder
with my foreshank as well.
