00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.970
So this is where my two legs
were attached, and my indicators are here

2
00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.342
moving forward from here
until that first bone is my loin.

3
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.179
So these are the more expensive cuts
in the center part.

4
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.016
So I want to make sure
that I'm very careful.

5
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.052
So on the top of this,

6
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.389
there's some bones
and on the bottom as well.

7
00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.958
I'm going to actually remove this

8
00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.361
by going through the vertebrae here.

9
00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.800
So. In that dagger grip.

10
00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:38.471
And I'm also going

11
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.574
to be using gravity here to help me out

12
00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:45.211
my knife cuts are nice and straight
so that my muscles,

13
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.847
you know, look beautiful on the plate.

14
00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.186
Just through that vertebrae.

15
00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.291
And there's my aitch bone.
