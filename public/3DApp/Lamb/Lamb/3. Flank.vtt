00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:04.137
Let's have a look inside of the carcass
to get a better view.

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.773
Going to make a couple of incisions
here on the belly

3
00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.010
just so that we can see
inside a little better.

4
00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.414
Just going to pull back a little bit here.

5
00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.783
And same here.

6
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.920
Good, to allow us a better view.

7
00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:25.925
So if you look inside, you see this
diaphragm piece here, OK,

8
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.928
this is what separates
the organs up in here.

9
00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:35.068
The lungs sit up in here and now we have
the intestines at the lower end here.

10
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:39.506
Now this cut, if this were a cow,
would be a skirt steak.

11
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:44.744
As you can see on our lamb,
as I'll show you here, it's quite thin.

12
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:50.083
So often times this cut,
if you would follow me

13
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.855
can get pushed into ground meat because
we want to remove this silver skin.

14
00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.191
And once we did that,
it would be almost nothing.

15
00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.027
So oftentimes
this gets pushed into our ground lamb.

16
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.831
I'll take
the same thing off on the other side.
