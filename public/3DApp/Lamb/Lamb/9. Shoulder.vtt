1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:04.070
Next, I'm
going to separate the neck from the rack.

2
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.473
So this is our most expensive cut.

3
00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.307
Again, the most sought

4
00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.977
after the one that you've seen
on every plate in most restaurants.

5
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.781
To do that, I'm going to flip it over.

6
00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.319
And we're going to count ribs together,
so I'm going to do

7
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.156
the ones on this side first,
and I'm going to count three ribs.

8
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.192
So one, two, three

9
00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.662
in between the third and the fourth is
where I want to make my incision.

10
00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.400
And for me,
I want to make my incision closest

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.603
to the neck side
to make my rack as big as it can be.

12
00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.740
You probably see my knife through there
and straight up to the top.

13
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.844
OK. Same on this side now counting

14
00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.982
one, two, three bones in between here.

15
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.385
Nice and long up.

16
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.186
Great.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.389
Now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to flip it over.

18
00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.760
I'm going to finish those cuts up
and through.

19
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.664
So just before I go, I'm checking
they should be lining up

20
00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.901
relatively the same, my fingers
can touch in the middle here now.

21
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.671
So I know I'm on track,
so I'm going to take this cut,

22
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.240
going to bring it up.

23
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.576
Across the top

24
00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:20.213
same thing on this side up across the top

25
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.550
with this one,
I'm going to cut right down to the bone

26
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.285
on the neck here.

27
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.689
Beautiful.

28
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.335
Next, I'm going to switch

29
00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.137
to my cleaver,

30
00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.473
and I'm going to separate it

31
00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.842
here now when I'm using my cleaver.

32
00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.479
It's not about how hard you can hit it,
it's about doing it accurately.

33
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.392
And I'm just going to finish those cuts
at the bottom.

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.363
I'm left with these two
that I'll leave on the carcass for now

35
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.365
and I'll separate
them when I get to the rack.
