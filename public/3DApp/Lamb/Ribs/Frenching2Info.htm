<p><b>String Frenching:</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Measure and draw a line across the rack where you will be Frenching (this step is called “scoring”)</li>
    <li>Remove “finger meat” by slicing from the top of the rib bone along one rib until the knife gets to your scored line, then turn the blade and cut up the next rib, these will be “U” shaped cuts. Repeat for all bones.</li>
    <li>Anchor string onto something heavy in kitchen</li>
    <li>Wrap string around your hand and pull gently to create tension (“taught” to pull tight)</li>
    <li>Hold rack in your other hand by slipping your fingers through the ribs and cradling the loin in your palm, it should look like the ribs are extending out of your knuckles</li>
    <li>Use your string hand to wrap the string around one of the ribs once to create a loop, try and get the loop as close to your scored line as possible, pull your string hand gently to create tension.</li>
    <li>Pull the entire rack (part that is in your hands) back and outwards while creating lots of tension with your string hand, so that the string slides down the rib and removes all connective tissue.</li>
    <li>Repeat with other bones.</li>
  </ol>
