00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.436
I'm going to cut some into chops.

2
00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:06.873
So we're apportioning this into chops,
you want to go straight down the middle.

3
00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.343
Nice long knife stroke.

4
00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.244
Beauty.

5
00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.092
So these chops portion like this,

6
00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.895
you can put them on the grill,
you could pan sear them nice and easy.

7
00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.297
Sometimes in restaurants as well,

8
00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.833
what we'll do is we'll apportion these
to like a three bone rack

9
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.669
like so.

10
00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:40.940
Pan sear this OK.

11
00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.842
And then we would slice it

12
00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.012
and present it on a plate so you can see
the beautiful, medium rare color.
