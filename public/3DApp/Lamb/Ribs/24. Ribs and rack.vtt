00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.268
Here's our rack of lamb.

2
00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.672
Next,
we're going to French this rack of lamb,

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.310
so to do that, I first
want to eye up where I want to cut it.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.413
So I've got some belly piece here as well
with these ribs.

5
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.183
OK, now this here,
this last piece of little meat

6
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.954
here is the last piece of tender meat
we have on the rack.

7
00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:24.691
After that, we're moving into the ribs,
which are a little bit more tough.

8
00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.129
So I do about three fingers
from the eye of the chop here,

9
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.765
and then I'm going to make
my indicating line.

10
00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.969
We're going to check

11
00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.038
on the opposite side.

12
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.373
three figures from there is here.

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:41.841
Great.

14
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.478
And a double check to make sure
that those line up, that's looking good.

15
00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.614
Got a nice line here.

16
00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.885
So I'm going to hang this
rack over the edge of my table.

17
00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.921
We're going to apply
a little downward pressure here.

18
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.795
You just watch your arm if you would Jay.

19
00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.131
Now this is these are easy to cut through,

20
00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.469
but a nice long stroke
is still what you want to here,

21
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.173
especially at the end.

22
00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.078
And now we have our belly

23
00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.481
and our- with our ribs,

24
00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.051
plus our rack ready to be Frenched.
