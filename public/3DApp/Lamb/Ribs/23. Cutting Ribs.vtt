00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.570
Here we are with a rack of lamb
now we're going to remove

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.840
each rack from that spine.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.743
And I want to be right in this spot.

4
00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.182
It's good to have a buddy..

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.784
come here.

6
00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:21.721
Good.

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.156
Now I got it going.

8
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.792
It's catching on the back here.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.462
So as you can see,

10
00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.865
nice and straight.

11
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:40.273
Nice long strokes with the saw.

12
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:44.644
What we have is a beautiful rack of lamb,

13
00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.647
no chine bone.

14
00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:48.815
Amazing.

15
00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.252
So that one we've done nice and neat

16
00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.791
the other way that we can do it,
this is using the cleaver.

17
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:02.228
So when we use the cleaver to do this,

18
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.436
it's a tricky one to get in there.

19
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:12.772
So when we do it,

20
00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.042
we want to point it at the spine here.

21
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:19.145
Come here, buddy. Here

22
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.047
we go.

23
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.749
And now.

24
00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.988
Again, keeping that back.

25
00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.863
And straight through.
