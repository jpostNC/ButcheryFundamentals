00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.770
So what we want to do now is French,
these bones so peeling back

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.306
some of the tougher fat and meat

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.110
to expose the bone
and make it look beautiful to start that,

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm going to remove some of this
belly here that's also attached.

5
00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.417
So we've got a seam under here.

6
00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.251
No problem.

7
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.121
We just got to find our way in.

8
00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.123
Start peeling.

9
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.125
You should see

10
00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.128
and hear that beautiful sound.

11
00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.135
Careful

12
00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.004
towards the end, you could damage
some of it if you're not careful.

13
00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.341
But I've been a little mark here
where I want to French to.

14
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.178
OK, so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to start

15
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.981
by scoring the back of these bones.

16
00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.353
And look at the angle of my knife,

17
00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.190
so it's almost like, well,
we call this bone skin.

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.394
It's a little bit of connective tissue
holding on to these bones,

19
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:06.099
and I'm going to turn it the other way
and I'm just going to get underneath it.

20
00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.671
Now, what I'm going to do is

21
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.076
I'm going to use the end of my knife here
and just try to get behind it.

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.579
This isn't something

23
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.581
that is easy to do,

24
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.817
but once you get the technique,
it's simple.

25
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.221
Also important here make sure that

26
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.824
no lamb fat on your knife,

27
00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.994
on the handle anyway
because my fingers are awfully close here.

28
00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.698
So because I've got behind that bone skin.

29
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.733
Check this out.

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.870
Just peels beautifully,

31
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.140
so I'm using my wrist here
to kind of turn a little bit,

32
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:51.578
and that's pushing that connective tissue
down.

33
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.545
Look at that.

34
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.115
So I'm going to keep going,

35
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.717
and now I'm just going to remove them.

36
00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.520
So I find it easy to go back to this side

37
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.390
because I want a nice straight
line across beautiful.

38
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.929
And then I can kind of go back

39
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.898
and just make sure.

40
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.239
Beautiful.

41
00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.207
Now I'm going to go back
and just touch them up

42
00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.510
and make sure there's no connective
tissue left on them.

43
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.778
And then.

44
00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.115
We'll move on to the other way.
