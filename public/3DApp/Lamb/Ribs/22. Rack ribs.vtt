00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.969
Here we are with the rack of lamb.

2
00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.307
So remember, here's
our indicator ribs from earlier.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.680
OK, now our goal here
is to make this into a rack of lamb.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.648
That means that if you look at it here,

5
00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.485
see our two beautiful racks
and our spine in the middle.

6
00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.688
If you look at it again, going back
this way,

7
00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.624
the lamb shows
you where our first cut is going to be.

8
00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.561
It's going to be right down the middle
here to separate these two racks.

9
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.966
And then we're going to peel
that meat away from this spine here

10
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.735
because you can see it. It's very thick

11
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:36.936
in the industry.

12
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.739
When you purchase racks of lamb
just by themselves,

13
00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.109
you want to make sure that you specify
that the chine bone is removed.

14
00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.212
That is this bone here,
because if it is not removed,

15
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.616
becomes really difficult
to cut it into portions later on.

16
00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.085
So I'm going to start

17
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.621
by first removing these.

18
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:03.663
Beautiful.

19
00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.666
OK, so

20
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.602
I'm going to start with a cut
that goes straight down the middle here.

21
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.739
Now this is the most expensive cut,

22
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.809
so you want to make sure
that you know where you're going.

23
00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.645
So if my line starts up here,

24
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.880
it's a great idea
to check on the other side.

25
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.482
Is it still there?

26
00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.716
Sure is.

27
00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.619
I'll start straight down.

28
00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:45.672
That's

29
00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.341
a great sound,
it means I'm right against that spine.

30
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:52.545
So the other thing is that there is a bone
that comes straight up here,

31
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.182
so I want to be on either side of it.

32
00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.230
That's a good sound.

33
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.000
Now, as I mentioned, you see, now
my two knife cuts are here and here.

34
00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:19.506
Now what I want to do is kind of move this
meat away from that spine a little bit.

35
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.909
So I'm just going to

36
00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.246
continue with that same cut,
but kind of turn a corner

37
00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:32.418
a little bit similar
to how we did on the saddle.

38
00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:37.090
We just look at it all the time
before we go cut it with our saw.

39
00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.827
You can see that
the chops are separated here.
