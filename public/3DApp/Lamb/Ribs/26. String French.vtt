1
00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.904
So our second
technique with frenching the rack of lamb.

2
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.706
A little bit different.

3
00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.676
But we're going to achieve the same result
nice clean bones here.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.080
This way,
I'm going to cut straight down here.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.016
This is going to be my indicator line.

6
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.451
Same as it was on this side.

7
00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.420
And then what I'm going to do

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.556
is I'm going to go down the bone on either
side.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.796
Down the bone here, over

10
00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:34.534
and up, the bone on the other side.

11
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.409
So I'm going to use a piece of string here

12
00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.114
anchored firmly.

13
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.749
And I

14
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.286
am right here,
so I'm going to take it, I'm

15
00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:57.157
going to wrap it around, my rack
right at the top.

16
00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:02.462
I'm going to make it taught,
I need to support the whole thing here.

17
00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:06.699
If you don't support the whole thing,
you could rip that bone

18
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.869
right out
and check that out nice and clean.

19
00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.739
So I'm going to work my way down

20
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:18.445
wrapping once, twice, make it taught,

21
00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.348
support the rack.

22
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.283
Beautiful.

23
00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:30.123
Now, as you get going here,
some of that fat can inhibit the friction

24
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.426
against the strings, so
you might need to use a couple of pieces.

25
00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.598
Beautiful.

26
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.000
Nice.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.772
Beautiful.

28
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.009
So two separate techniques
for one beautiful Frenched rack.
