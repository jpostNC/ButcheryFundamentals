00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.503
Now I'm going to remove our inside round
here.

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.573
It's a little easier
if I bring it towards me,

3
00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.842
but simply,
I'm going to follow these seams here.

4
00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.612
So talking about that seam butchery,
it'll tell you where to go

5
00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.418
shouldn't be cutting into meat here.

6
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.395
Also attached to this as well,

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.367
we've got some of this
that's just at the end of our shank.

8
00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.903
It's got a whole bunch of connective
tissue there

9
00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.572
and that's
why it's coming off of our inside round.
