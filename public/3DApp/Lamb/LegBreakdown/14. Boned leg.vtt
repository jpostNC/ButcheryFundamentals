00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.336
So here's our lamb
shank that we've removed from our leg.

2
00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.339
Again, this cut is very tough.

3
00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.477
We want to braise this one low and slow
to break down that connective tissue.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.745
You see it.

5
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.913
You can see that
connective tissue in there.

6
00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.582
And that's what we want to break down.

7
00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.785
Moving into the leg,
the leg is a medium tender cut.

8
00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.421
This is a cut that we can roast and serve.

9
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.088
Medium rare.

10
00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.324
It's a little bit more forgiving than that
shank.

11
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.560
Now we're going to start by boning it out

12
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.132
so I can see where that shank started
and where

13
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.668
that ball joint is on the other side.

14
00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:40.807
So basically, to get this bone out I'm
going to draw a line between these two.

15
00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.612
So I'm going to use this line
here on the animal itself to guide me.

16
00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:49.983
So I'm going to go

17
00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:53.686
straight down against that bone
all the way through

18
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.291
to see it on the bottom.

19
00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.564
Once I can see it.

20
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.203
I'm going to go all the way around it.

21
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.591
We go

22
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:36.196
now, I'm going to just kind of stand
this up.

23
00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.032
And Trace downwards towards me.

24
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.373
At this point as well,

25
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.742
there's a little kneecap in here
that I like

26
00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.846
to make sure
that I've got on the bone as well.

27
00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.883
I'll show it to you once I take it out.

28
00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.390
So inside of here,

29
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.528
got that little floating kneecap.

30
00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.964
You can see it right there. OK.

31
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.031
And that's what I like to keep it

32
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.035
on the bone here
so that I know it's not in my leg muscles

33
00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.239
and this is that collagen
that we're looking at inside of here.

34
00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.942
And we talk about a lot.

35
00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.044
Now here's my

36
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.680
boned out leg of lamb.
