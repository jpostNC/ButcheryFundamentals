00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.170
Here's our sirloin just connected
by this little piece here.

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.806
I'm just simply going
to give a little cut.

3
00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.510
And that's going to show us our sirloin.

4
00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.580
Next up, the knuckle

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.682
while we're talking about this sirloin
here.

6
00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.751
It's a beautiful roast will clean this up

7
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.986
clear a little bit of this
connective tissue.

8
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.822
We can roll this up and roasted,
served, medium rare. Be delicious.
