00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.004
This is a tougher cut.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.406

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.340
This could be ground.

5
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.844
You can cut it up into cubes,
maybe marinate it, but

6
00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.014
it's a little bit tougher and a little bit
more challenging to handle.
