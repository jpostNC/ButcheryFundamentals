1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.136
So here's our inside that we just removed.

2
00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.305
We're going to see the outside here.

3
00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:09.009
The sirloin at the bottom
and the knuckle here inside

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.811
the knuckle is also the eye of the round,
though I'll show you in a moment.

5
00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.347
So outside
round is what I'm going to do next.

6
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.350
And that's simply following this seam
straight down

7
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.087
and around the corner and out.

8
00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.426
Inside outside.
