00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.269
Now we're going to look at the leg,

2
00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.006
so this is a whole lamb leg.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.075
first up, what I'd like to do

4
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:13.246
is I'm going to French this shank bone
and remove the shank.

5
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.216
So this is the Achilles here.

6
00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:20.153
So this is where they would hang up
this animal after it was killed.

7
00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.923
first up, I'm going to remove that.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.596
Next,
I'm going to French around this bone.

9
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:33.066
So cutting through the little bit of flesh
that we have here

10
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.470
all the way down to the bone
and all the way around.

11
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.809
I'm now going to scrape this bone

12
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.611
and clean it up.

13
00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.491
It's a little tricky to get at it,

14
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:02.028
so find what's working here.

15
00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.197
And so when we're frenching a bone,

16
00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:08.468
we're exposing the bone
to make it look more elegant on the plate.

17
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.606
We do not want any connective
tissue on it.

18
00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.544
Actually going

19
00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.980
to push it away from me.

20
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:28.521
So we

21
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.691
french the shank bone here,
I just give it a little trim with my saw.

22
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.726
Now I'm going to remove the shank.

23
00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.795
So right in here.

24
00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.865
There's a sweet spot.

25
00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.171
Where it's really nice and easy

26
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.074
to get through this joint.

27
00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.646
To remove our shank,
so I started it there.

28
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.349
You need to get in the end of my night
in here.

29
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.888
There we go.

30
00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.757
And now I want to cut this nice
and straight.

31
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.194
Beautiful.

32
00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.864
So here we have our lamb shank.

33
00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.700
OK. You can almost see that now

34
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.637
braised in a beautiful brown sauce
sitting on the plate just like that.
