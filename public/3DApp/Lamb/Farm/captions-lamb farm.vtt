00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.400
so we always try to keep the utmost care of the&nbsp;
animals in mind, we're obviously in it to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.320
a bit of money but care for animals always helps, we want to make things as simple and as easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.680
as possible for ourselves as well as providing a&nbsp;
quality product for our consumers, the size we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.400
at we generally wholesale but we try and pick&nbsp;
who we wholesale to and people who meet our own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.680
philosophies and basically get the best quality&nbsp;
that we can on the land and resources we're given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.040
so the lambs are usually anywhere from five&nbsp;
to six/seven months old when they hit our target&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.640
weight we usually try to aim for about 110&nbsp;
pounds, for us that's just basically the weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.600
the market can handle and I mean I love putting&nbsp;
weight on lambs once they get past 50 or 60 pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.160
it's just purely eating right they just get&nbsp;
in there and go so the heavier the better but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.480
yeah about seven months so probably top, so it's about 50 or 60% grass depending on who you talk to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
to but once the end was cleaned it's about&nbsp;
half the weight so be about 60/65 pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.400
us generally we also grow all the crops&nbsp;
to feed our animals so spring would start with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.400
a lambing group usually that we've bred in the&nbsp;
fall it's about five months wait and so we'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.960
have a lamb group probably february-march or so&nbsp;
and hopefully if we planned it right they'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.200
done by the time we get to april may and we can&nbsp;
start a bit of field work getting some crops in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.360
the ground getting everything worked up and&nbsp;
then we start harvesting hay crop pretty soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.720
that's an annual crop so it's just usually ready&nbsp;
year-round perennials so yeah we'll start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.160
harvesting hay mid-summer we'll start lambing&nbsp;
again a little bit, we try and lamb every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.920
other month if we can, so usually small enough&nbsp;
groups so we can handle it on the fly and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.640
keep working on the land and get crops in, we start doing the small grains like wheat and barley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.480
maybe mid july or so into august and then the end&nbsp;
of august we start getting into second cut hay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.560
hopefully at that point maybe&nbsp;
even third cut hay at that point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.560
and get into some soybeans starting early&nbsp;
fall and then corn is usually ready about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.080
November/December and the other side we try&nbsp;
to lamb pretty much throughout that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.360
every other month every month if we can so&nbsp;
lambing we usually take a group of about 100&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.040
animals, we get them all bred at the same time&nbsp;
lambing would be when they actually give birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.840
and we put them through our system and start&nbsp;
going from there, so sheep being what we call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.520
ruminants in that they have a large essentially&nbsp;
vat of a stomach that helps them digest all kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.200
of forages all kinds of greenery so they're&nbsp;
usually fed primarily a forage based diet so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.720
your hay your basically the full plant while it's&nbsp;
still green, it makes some really good grazers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.680
so yeah we go with probably about 60 to 70 percent&nbsp;
of that in their ration we also feed them a fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.360
bit of corn a fair bit of a protein supplement for&nbsp;
us we use dried distillers grains that's the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.640
source and then whatever other minerals we feel&nbsp;
they're deficient in we kind of wrap that all up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.840
into one mixed blend and feed it to them as you go&nbsp;
as you can see here our lambs get a bit more corn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.480
but it's generally all fed as one single&nbsp;
ration and we feed daily and make sure we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.840
keep an eye on everybody, antibiotics usually&nbsp;
in the lambs especially at a very young age&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.840
they're prone to gut parasites which can&nbsp;
be a little bit nasty some days so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.640
in our starter creep feed so the feed that the&nbsp;
lambs get while they're still on their mums&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.400
there's a bit of a antibiotic in&nbsp;
there just to try and help with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.520
and then again into our lambs it's a little bit&nbsp;
milder again but that does help with that and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.600
notice when it's missing get a lot bigger outbreak&nbsp;
of those diseases so there is withdrawal time too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.680
they have to come off the feed soon enough before&nbsp;
shipped so that we make sure that none of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.640
actually makes it into the meat into the packing&nbsp;
plants so we follow all those guidelines as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.840
yeah, my name's Kevin Lamb I'm a sheep farmer&nbsp;
and this is my story so, go eat some lamb
