00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:04.904
Now that we've flipped the animal onto its
back, you can see inside of the cavity,

2
00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:09.142
when we first look into the cavity,
you'll see some offal.

3
00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.711
So first that I've noticed
is the heart here.

4
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.414
And this is the heart.

5
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.817
It's lightly connected here,
but it's important to note

6
00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.553
that this has been sliced
in two different spots

7
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.990
by the grading inspector.

8
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.192
This happens often
they're inspecting for disease,

9
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.496
and this is one of the spots
that they look.

10
00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.166
Next, the liver.

11
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.667
Liver looks like.

12
00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.504
So just give me a second to remove.

13
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.273
Lovely.

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.043
And here is our liver.

15
00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.412
Beautiful.

16
00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.615
Inside the cavity next is the kidneys,

17
00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:52.318
so the kidneys are coated in suet.

18
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.055
So this is the fat
that's on the inside of the cavity.

19
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.589
It's referred to as suet.

20
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.296
Sometimes we even use some of

21
00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.499
this fat
to coat them and roast them in it.

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.836
So this one, you might be able
to get a better look at when I remove

23
00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.339
just pulling on that suet.

24
00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.176
And out comes the kidney,

25
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.446
so you'll see as well
this has been slit by the inspector too.
