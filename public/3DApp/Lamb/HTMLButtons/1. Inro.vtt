Hi, I'm
chef Scott Royce of Loyalist College.

2
00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:07.140
Welcome to today's butchery session
today, we'll be discussing Ontario Lamb,

3
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:12.212
so I have in front of me an Ontario lamb
before I talk about these cuts.

4
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.449
I wanted to highlight
that the muscle structure and bone

5
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.786
structure of an animal with four legs
is very similar.

6
00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.690
This is a lamb again,
which is a sheep under one year old,

7
00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.327
but the cuts will be very similar in a pig
or in a cow.

8
00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.531
Those cuts, as we get larger into account,
for example, you'll see more of them

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.233
and they'll have different names.

10
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.735
But today
we're going to be doing some comparisons

11
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.105
and showing you the highlights
of how they're similar and different.

12
00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.741
So let's get into it.

13
00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
We see first on our lamb the neck.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.912
OK, so that's this part here.

15
00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.515
The neck typically goes till about here.

16
00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.784
OK, then we have our shoulders.

17
00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.986
We have two, one on either side.

18
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:53.720
This incision

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.023
that you see here is going to kind of show
that curvature of that shoulder.

20
00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.894
So there's that curvature of the shoulder
attached to the shoulder is

21
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.861
the four shank

22
00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:04.764
then, as I mentioned, that

23
00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:08.201
neck comes to about here
and then we have our rack of lamb.

24
00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.303
So this is the most expensive cut

25
00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.906
and the one that you see typically
on a lot of restaurant menus.

26
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.711
After that,
we have the saddle or the loin. OK.

27
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.114
And then that leads into the leg.

28
00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:24.150
That leg you can see starts here
where this curvature starts

29
00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.686
and goes all the way down to here.

30
00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.123
And then we have the hind
shank here at the end.

31
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.094
It's important to note as well
those tenderloins are

32
00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.963
inside of the cavity, parallel

33
00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.467
on either side to the spine,
and I'll show you that later on.
