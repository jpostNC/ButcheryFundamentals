okay so what we have here is three types of clams&nbsp;
we have the cherry stone we have the little neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.600
and we have the quahogs now a couple things&nbsp;
to remember when you're cooking clams is first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.880
that you want to make sure they're alive so if&nbsp;
they're open and you tap them they should close up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.640
if they don't then you just discard&nbsp;
them you also want to make sure they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.320
clean I like to use a little green&nbsp;
scrubby to clean off any of the sand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.040
when you're cooking them so when cooking&nbsp;
them it's the abductor muscle that holds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.559
shell together and that's where the meat is so&nbsp;
when they cook they cook all different times
