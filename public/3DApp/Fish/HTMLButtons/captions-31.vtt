00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.240
so what we have here is an oyster which is a&nbsp;
bivalve which means that there is two shells to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.720
there's a flat top and there's what we call a bowl&nbsp;
so we want to make sure that the bowl is downward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.720
so that when we do open it that the juices stay in&nbsp;
now what holds the two shells together is called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.400
the abductor muscle and it sits right in the&nbsp;
center here and the more we try and force it open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.120
the tighter it holds so it's going to take a&nbsp;
little bit of force you also want to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.080
that they're alive and how do you know they're&nbsp;
alive if there is a bit of a space and they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.680
closing when you tap them that means that they're&nbsp;
dead so this one is alive it's it's nice and tight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.240
and in order to open it I'm going to use what's&nbsp;
called an oyster knife this is a very strong knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.080
you can see it's very thick with a good handle on&nbsp;
it and so what I need to do is just put my towel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.240
on top now this can be dangerous in case it slips&nbsp;
i want to hit the towel not my hand and again make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.600
sure that the bowl is on the bottom if not all&nbsp;
of the juices fall out and that's not what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
trying to do we're trying to keep all of those&nbsp;
juices so we need to get the tip of our knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.520
into that little space inside and then with some&nbsp;
force pushing inward and twisting simultaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.000
you just want to break that abductor muscle which&nbsp;
is what we did there and then again being very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.200
careful I want to just cut the upper part of the&nbsp;
abductor muscle from the upper shell leaving as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.000
much in the bowl as possible sometimes the shell&nbsp;
cracks just be very careful that you don't get any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.560
of this loose bits in there and then you want&nbsp;
to just take them all out wipe your knife move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.560
the oyster over to the side here you can see it's&nbsp;
in a bowl sometimes that bowl won't set perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.520
so what we'll do is we'll put that on some crushed&nbsp;
ice but before I can serve it I need to loosen the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.760
bottom of the abductor muscle as well and there&nbsp;
you go now it's nice and loose the only other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.856
thing that this may need is a little bit of&nbsp;
lemon juice if you like or some tabasco sauce
