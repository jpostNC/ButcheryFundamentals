00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.840
so what we have here is the shrimp and this is&nbsp;
basically 16 to 20 shrimp is the number 16 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.040
20 means that there's generally 16 to 20 per&nbsp;
pound this is a whole shrimp with everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.680
on including the head this is also known&nbsp;
as what we call a crustacean so you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.440
how the shell sits on top of the next shell in&nbsp;
order to clean this the first thing we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.680
to do is remove the head so i'll just grab the&nbsp;
shrimp and then pull the head off just like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.440
the next thing that I want&nbsp;
to do is I want to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.600
the shell and how I do is I just peel it just&nbsp;
like you're grabbing the side of it and peeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.160
it if you want to you can peel it all the way&nbsp;
down including removing the tail if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
to have the tail off some people like to leave the&nbsp;
tail on the next thing that I want to do is I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.840
to de-vein it so deveining it means cutting open&nbsp;
the back with a nice sharp knife be very careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.680
and then you want to look for the vein that's&nbsp;
inside here and the vein is basically the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.200
waste track so then you would take a paper&nbsp;
towel and then just clean it out just like that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.520
and then you would place it down and that's clean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.384
these shells are great you can&nbsp;
make a nice stalk out of them
