00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.880
so here what we have is a squid&nbsp;
so the first thing I'm going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.200
is I'm going to pull out this&nbsp;
section right here being very careful

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.920
and then I need to pull out

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.400
i also need to pull out the&nbsp;
quill which is right here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.720
this part is what we make the rings with so&nbsp;
let me just pat dry you can see that some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.320
the squid ink is coming out the squid ink is is&nbsp;
really important as well but let's first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:43.840
pull the wings off here which are edible and&nbsp;
as well we can see where we get calamari from

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.880
again you want to keep your board nice and tidy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
the squid ink is what's used&nbsp;
as a mechanism to defend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.440
the squid when it's under water and what it does&nbsp;
is it shoots out this ink which colors the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.920
and then it can escape so this is what we use&nbsp;
for the rings on the top here what we have is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.640
beak so we want to get the beak out so we just&nbsp;
turn it upside down and we just squeeze to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.520
the beak out and there it is you can see it coming&nbsp;
out right there so we don't eat the beak so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.280
gonna put that over there and within this sack&nbsp;
right here is where we can actually get the ink

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.840
for the squid ink so let's just cut

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.920
right here and you can see that I actually&nbsp;
just cut right through the squid ink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.560
sack now this ink is also used for&nbsp;
cooking we can use it for coloring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.863
pasta or a number of other dishes like even a&nbsp;
result of which i've used before there you have it
