so what we have here is an octopus so&nbsp;
let me identify some of the parts here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.400
we have the head here and we have the tentacles&nbsp;
here now the skin doesn't need to be removed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.840
cook it, it normally comes off when you cook it&nbsp;
underneath here is the beak and so what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.880
need to do is we need to remove the beak and&nbsp;
to remove it basically what we want to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.125
just go from the opposite side and squeeze and&nbsp;
then the beak comes out so let me just squeeze

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.911
there it is there's the beak
