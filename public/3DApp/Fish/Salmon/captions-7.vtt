00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.280
so what we have here is a beautiful atlantic&nbsp;
salmon so what we want to look for is freshness in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.240
this we want to make sure that the flesh bounces&nbsp;
back we want to make sure that the gills have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.240
nice look to them that there's no fishy smell&nbsp;
in them the eyes aren't sunken in I have that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.440
nice sort of shock look we want to look to make&nbsp;
sure that the innards don't have any blood spots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.760
on it and that it's nice and fresh and we want&nbsp;
to check both sides too right to make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.360
there's nothing damaged on here and that&nbsp;
again it's not a slimy texture as well

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
now there are a number of ways of purchasing&nbsp;
it this way that we've purchased it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.080
has all of the scales removed sometimes they&nbsp;
have the fins removed all of the innards taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.360
out and this is what we call whole dressed you&nbsp;
could also get it already the pin bones removed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.480
this one still has the skin on it uh but this&nbsp;
is another way of purchasing it with this pin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.015
bones removed and the rib cage removed

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:01.814
this&nbsp;
fish is called anodimus which means it starts off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:07.760
in the fresh water goes to the salt water and&nbsp;
then comes back this is a round fish which has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.200
two fillets in it one on each side now we're&nbsp;
going to take the fillets apart on this fish
