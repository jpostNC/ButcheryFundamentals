so once the steak is cut the next thing&nbsp;
you want to do is just fold in these pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.240
you don't want to lose those pieces and you want&nbsp;
it to cook completely so what I like to do is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.440
to take a little piece of butcher's twine tie&nbsp;
it around I usually do an extra slip just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.120
that and then tie it not too tight and then just&nbsp;
enough to hold it together and then I would just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.102
trim it like this and then trim off any excess&nbsp;
string and it'd be just perfect for poaching
