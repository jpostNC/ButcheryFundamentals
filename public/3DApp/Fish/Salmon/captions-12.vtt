okay so to fillet this we look at the backbone&nbsp;
here and so what we want to do is we want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.480
use our knife to go along the backbone and we&nbsp;
want to use pressure on the back of our knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.560
and slide it along the backbone like&nbsp;
this with our knife turned up slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.840
you don't want to go too high up because&nbsp;
then you'll lose meat if you go too far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.800
down you'll go right through the backbone so let's&nbsp;
start we're going to start by just first cutting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.840
the first bone and it's going to take a second to&nbsp;
crack to go through and then once it goes through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.320
it's just going to go through quite easily again&nbsp;
moving it like a saw and using the back bone

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.064
as a guide

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.600
so if you missed any of the meat on here you just&nbsp;
take a spoon and just drag it along the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.609
just like this and you want to get all of that&nbsp;
meat, it's very expensive so there's no sense to waste it

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:13.749
a little bit here on the back

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.320
take a look at that that's about half a portion&nbsp;
of meat that you could use in one of your recipes
