00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
so now we have all of the pin bones&nbsp;
removed and the rib bones removed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.440
the next thing to do is to portion it we're going&nbsp;
to leave the skin on here and to get an even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.880
consistent portion I have a digital scale I like&nbsp;
to wrap my digital scale and saran wrap to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.080
it nice and clean and tidy that way when I need&nbsp;
to reuse it I can just take the saran wrap off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.200
so let's start by cutting a portion what I want to&nbsp;
do is use the same knife that I was using before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.720
very sharp in a nice even slice so I want to go&nbsp;
back and then forth and because the skin is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.080
i might need to just put a little bit of pressure&nbsp;
but then I could cut it just like this so then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.713
what i'll do is i'll put it on the scale and make&nbsp;
sure that all of the portions are the same size
