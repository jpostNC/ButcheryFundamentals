00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
so before we do any filleting in the fish what&nbsp;
we want to do is remove all the scales which have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040
been removed and now we're going to remove&nbsp;
the dorsal fin and the adipose fin and any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.960
other fins that are on here to make it nice and&nbsp;
clean so that when we do fillet it, the knife flows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.040
completely through so we'll start off by removing&nbsp;
the dorsal fin we have a nice pair of what we call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.560
kitchen shears here these are probably one of the&nbsp;
most important tools next to your french knife you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.520
can cut chicken with this fish bones with this&nbsp;
and you want to make sure it's nice and sharp

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.400
we also want to remove the adipose fin here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.374
and again these are what we want&nbsp;
to do to get a nice clean fillet
