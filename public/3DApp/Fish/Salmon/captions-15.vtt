00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.040
so the next stage that we're going to do here&nbsp;
is remove the pin bones and how we remove them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.800
is we feel for them by going against the&nbsp;
grain here so once we find them we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.920
grab them with the tweezers and pull out now&nbsp;
the important thing is to have a bowl of water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640
dip her tweezers in it helps&nbsp;
to get rid of the pin bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.560
and cleans your tweezers at the same time so&nbsp;
again if you can't see where the tweezers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.051
then what you need to do is just use&nbsp;
your finger along the edge to find them

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.840
and you've got to remove all of them&nbsp;
there's quite a few of them in here
