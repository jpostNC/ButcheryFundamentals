00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.720
so the next thing I want to do is show you&nbsp;
how to remove the skin so what I like to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.640
to use my knife go right down to the skin and&nbsp;
then use a piece of paper towel or a dry towel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.520
just to grab the skin at the same time that i'm&nbsp;
grabbing the skin I'm going to actually move the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.440
knife and the skin back and forth all the way and&nbsp;
it should come off just like butter especially if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.600
your knife is nice and sharp once we do that&nbsp;
we just remove the salmon and you can see i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.480
got most of it up and the skin is just like that&nbsp;
now some people like to take the skin and cook it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.609
it depends on what the application you want to use
