00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.560
okay so the next thing I want to do is i&nbsp;
want to fillet the fish but before I fillet it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
i'm going to cut the head off now normally&nbsp;
i would cut the head as close as I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.080
behind the gill so that we don't waste anything&nbsp;
but since I'm also going to show you how to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.640
what's called a darn or a steak I'm just&nbsp;
going to cut a straight cut and any excess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.080
meat we'll use in another recipe so what&nbsp;
you want to do is have a nice sharp knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.560
and I'm just going to go right behind here and a&nbsp;
nice straight angle so moving the knife like a saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.280
to get all the way through and then I'm gonna&nbsp;
go right through the backbone with this knife

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.560
and again that sawing action&nbsp;
should get it nice and complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.840
so there is a little excess meat in here but&nbsp;
we're going to use that in another recipe
