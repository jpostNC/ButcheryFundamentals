<p>The fish covered in this module, except for Icelandic Plaice, are all native to North America and have provided sustenance and sources of protein and nutrition for first nations peoples for thousands of years.
</p>

<p>Fish can be classified and categorized into many types which can be self-explanatory in their classifications:</p>
Round Fish or Flat Fish<br>
Ocean Fish or Freshwater fish<br>
Coldwater, cool water or warm water<br>
Lean Fish or Oily Fish<br>
Wild Fish or Farmed Fish<br>

<p><b>Round Fish:</b> <br>
    Produce 2 fillets per fish, and typically have pin bones. They can be lean or oily and live in the ocean and freshwater. Examples are Rainbow Trout, salmon and Largemouth Bass
</p>

<p><b>Flat Fish:</b> <br>
    Flat fish produce 4 fillets per fish and have white flesh. They typically have no pin bones. These fish swim parallel to the seabed. Most bottom feeders are flat. Most flat fish are white lean fish.  Examples of flat fish are:
    <br>
    Halibut, Dover sole, lemon sole, flounder, plaice, turbot. 
</p>

<p><b>Oily Fish</b> <br>
    Oily fish have oil in their flesh tissue, belly cavity and guts. Their fillets can contain up to 30% oil. Oily fish are a very good source of vitamin A and D and are also very high in Omega 3 fatty acids which are an anti-inflammatory for arthritis. Proven health benefits for cardiovascular disease. They have two fillets per fish. Can be found in ocean or freshwater. Types of oily fish include: Sardines, Tuna, Salmon, Trout
</p>

<p><b>Smaller Fish:</b> Anchovies, Sardines, Herrings, Mackerel, Rainbow trout, Brown trout, Brook trout
</p>

<p><b>Larger Fish:</b> Salmon, Arctic char, Tuna, Shark, Swordfish    
</p>

<p><b>Ocean & Freshwater:</b>
</p>

<p>Fish live in both freshwater and saltwater and the difference between them is purely a physiological adaptation. Freshwater fish have adapted to their environment.
</p>

<p> The flesh of saltwater fish will not be noticeably saltier than the flesh of freshwater fish. However, saltwater fish retain less water in their flesh as the saltwater draws away moisture from their body.
</p>

<p> There are both flatfish and round fish that swim in both fresh and salt waters. Freshwater fish are often called lake fish & saltwater fish are often called ocean fish.
</p>

<p><b>Anadromous fish</b> are born in freshwater and spend most of their life in the sea and return to freshwater to spawn. Salmon, smelt, shad, striped bass, and sturgeon are common examples.</p>

<p><b>Catadromous fish</b> do the opposite - live in freshwater and enter salt water to spawn. Most of the eels are catadromous.</p>

<p><b>Wild & Farmed</b> <br> Refers to how a fish is raised. Wild means they were caught by traps, nets or hooks from the ocean, lakes and rivers in their natural habitat and have lived off of food that they have eaten from the wild.</p>

<p><b>Farmed fish:</b> are harvested from enclosed areas, these can be on land in rivers or in the ocean. They have been fed a diet provided by humans. There are many methods of fish farming. Some are harmful to the environment, and some are sustainable.
