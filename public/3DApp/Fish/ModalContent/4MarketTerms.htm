<p><b>Fishmonger:</b> person who sells and butchers fish.</p>

<p>Generally, all animals and fish have a cheaper price per kilo/pound when they are sold live or whole. Anytime a product needs to be further processed or packaged, which is really the role of a butcher or fishmonger, then the price goes up.</p>

<p><b>Eviscerated:</b> an animal or fish that have had their entrails (Stomach, heart liver kidneys, intestinal tract) removed.</p>

<p><b>Whole:</b> sold completely intact as caught.</p>

<p><b>Fillet:</b> (Noun) A boneless piece of fish, usually a whole side.</p>

<p><b>Live:</b> In Canada, fish and shellfish are the only living creatures that do not need to be inspected by the federal or provincial government after the slaughter. Fish and shellfish can be sold live and also can be held in tanks in foodservice operations.</p>

<p><b>Steaks:</b> Cut from a fillet and portioned to a specific weight.</p>

<p><b>Smoked:</b> The fish can be either cold or hot smoked and are edible when purchased.</p>

<p><b>Salted:</b> The fish has been salted, which removes the water and preserves the fish to be shelf stable at room temperature.</p>

<p><b>Scaled:</b> the fish has been descaled.</p>

<p><b>Canned:</b> The market is growing for canned seafood. Usually, fish are canned in water or oil. They are edible direct from the cans as they have been sealed under steamed pressure to preserved them and kill any harmful bacteria.</p>
