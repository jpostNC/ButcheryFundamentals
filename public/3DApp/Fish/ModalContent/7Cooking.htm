<p>Fish, Crustaceans and Mollusks are delicious, and a good source of protein and oily fish contain omega 3 fatty acids. <br>
    Fish do not contain the same connective tissue as land animals so therefore their flesh is a lot more tender and flakey. Fish cooks a lot faster than meat, so it is very easy to overcook. <br>
    There are endless ways they can be prepared for consumption and since fish are eaten around the world there are many exciting ways to enjoy them. <br>
</p>

<p>
    They can be eaten raw and cold as in sushi, sashimi, carpaccio, tartare and crudo. <br>
    They can be lightly marinated and “cooked” in citrus as in ceviche. <br>
    They can be battered and fried like fish and chips or Tempura. <br>
    They can be made into soups and stews like lobster bisques or cioppino or fish head curry. <br>
    They can be grilled, like salmon or swordfish. <br>
    They can be poached in a delicious broth. <br>
    They can be lightly steamed to preserve their delicate flavour. <br>
    They can be fermented into kimchi or fish sauce and used to create umami. <br>
    They can be roasted whole. <br>
    They can be marinated in maple syrup, smoked and air dried into salmon candy. <br>
    They can be dehydrated into jerky. <br>
    The possibilities are endless. <br>
