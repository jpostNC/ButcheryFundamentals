<p>The government of Canada refers to Mollusks and Crustaceans as Shellfish, but they are 2 distinct categories of marine life.</p>

<p>Fish, crustaceans and mollusks are sometimes collectively referred to as <b>seafood.</b></p>

<p>Crustaceans and mollusks are sometimes collectively referred to as <b>shellfish.</b></p>

<p><b>Crustaceans</b></p>

<p>“Crustaceans are aquatic animals that have jointed legs, a hard shell and no backbone, such as crab, crayfish, lobster, prawns and shrimp. Most mollusks have a hinged two-part shell and include clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, as well as various types of octopus, snail and squid.”<br>

<p><b>Shellfish- Mollusks</b></p>

<p><b>Mollusks:</b> are soft sea animals and invertebrates. They make up approximately 23% of all marine life.</p>

<p>Mollusks have a mantle (a dorsal body wall that covers their visceral mass) and a nervous system.</p>

<p>Mollusks can be subclassified into three major groups:</p>

<p><b>Univalves:</b> which have a single shell (snails, cockles, abalone)</p>

<p><b>Bivalves:</b> which have a pair of hinged shells (scallops, oysters, mussels, clams)</p>

<p><b>Cephalopods:</b> have a bilateral body system, a prominent head and arms or tentacles (examples: octopus, cuttlefish)</p>
