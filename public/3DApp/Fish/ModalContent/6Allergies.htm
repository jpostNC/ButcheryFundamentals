<p>Food Allergy Canada, a not for profit organization dedicated to helping Canadians with food allergies live with confidence, list “Fish” and “Crustaceans and Mollusks” as 2 separate categories in their list of the 10 most common food allergies. People who are allergic to fish might not be allergic to Crustaceans and Mollusks. People who have allergies can die if they ingest food for which they have an allergy. It is very important to ensure that you do not cross contaminate other food or equipment or tools when handling Fish or Crustaceans and Mollusks.</p>

<p>Sometimes fish are ingredients in other dishes, for example anchovies (a small, salted fish), are a common ingredient in the popular Caesar Dressing. <br>
