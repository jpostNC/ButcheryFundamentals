<p>Sustainability is a major concern in the fishing industry in Ontario, Canada and around the world. The east coast cod fishery collapsed in Canada in the 1990s and a moratorium was placed on cod fishing. The concept and intention of sustainable fishing is to leave enough fish in the ocean and to protect the habitat of marine life so that many consumed species continue to thrive. Activists argue that we should stop eating wild fish and only eat farmed fish. Other activists argue that farmed fish is worse for the environment. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' State of the World's Fisheries and Aquaculture 2020,  59.5 million people are employed in the fishery sector in the world.</p>

<p>There are many organizations such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Oceanwise and Slow Fish who state their mission is to protect the oceans and marine life while also protecting fisher people and the fishing Industry. These organizations provide tools for consumers and governments to make informed decisions about how their fish is caught and harvested. There are many unsustainable practices that cause our fish stocks to be depleted and harvested to a point of extinction. That is why there are catch limits and quotas determined each year based on researched fish stock levels. Some harmful practices have been outlawed like bottom trawling- which grabs everything from the ocean floor. </p>
    
<p>Other issues are ghost fishing- where nets and traps have been lost but continue to trap and kill fish and shellfish year after year.</p>

<p>The concept of <b>bycatch</b> which happens when nets or long lines of hooks capture everything- the bycatch (often dead) is then discarded if it doesnâ€™t meet the size limit or intended fish.</p>
