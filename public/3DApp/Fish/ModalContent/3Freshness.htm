<p>Fish <br>
Should be eaten as quickly as possible after harvesting. Many fish are frozen to maintain their quality and then thawed prior to sale.<br>
To determine freshness fish should smell like the ocean, they should not smell “fishy” or of ammonia. <br>
Their flesh should be pliable when touched. <br>
Their eyes should be clear. <br>
Their gills should be red. <br>
Their scales should not fall off easily <br>
</p>

<p>While storing, maintain a temperature of <b>30-32°F (-1to 1ºC)</b>. Keeping fish over ice helps keep them as cold as possible. Use a drip pan to allow for melting ice to drain away. Change the ice daily.</p>

<p>If you are thawing frozen fish, do so slowly in a fridge. Never keep for more than 2-3 days</p>

<p>Keep fish covered so they don't absorb other strong flavours in the fridge.</p>

<p><b>Mollusks and Crustaceans</b> <br>
    Bivalves like mussels and clams and oysters' shells should be closed. If they are broken or do not close when gently tapped- do not use them they should be discarded. <br>
    Live crustaceans like lobsters and crabs should be very active. If they are limp and not moving with energy this is an indication that they are dying and might not be very fresh. <br>
</p>

<p>While storing, maintain a temperature of <b>30-32°F (-1to 1ºC)</b>. Keep fish moist to protect the delicate flesh from damage</p>
