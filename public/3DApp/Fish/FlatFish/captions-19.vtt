00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:03.200
so what we have here is it's&nbsp;
called an icelantic place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.065
as you&nbsp;
see the way it looks it's camouflaged with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:13.105
these dots on it and a dark colored skin now when&nbsp;
this fish is born it actually swims like a round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:18.545
fish this is called a flat fish but then&nbsp;
eventually it starts to turn sideways and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:25.466
the eyes evolve to being both on the dark side the&nbsp;
skin here so it sits at the bottom of the seabed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:30.000
just waiting for its prey to come by as you&nbsp;
see it's camouflaged so the prey would not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.002
see it and then it would just jump up&nbsp;
and eat it the other thing about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:40.007
flat fish is that there is four fillets so&nbsp;
there's one two and if we flip it over there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:45.334
two in the other side and you can see that this&nbsp;
is also white and there is no eyes on this side
