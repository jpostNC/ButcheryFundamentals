00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.880
let's go on to the second side

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.080
and we're going to do the same thing on this&nbsp;
side so you can see the center bone on this side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.440
so we're just going to cut all the way down using&nbsp;
the tip of our knife and continue all the way

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.765
again you want to hear that&nbsp;
sound going against the ribcage

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.960
if there is any excess skin you can easily&nbsp;
trim that off and I'll remove the fourth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.920
fillet as you can see there is four fillets&nbsp;
on here again that backbone is sticking up

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.735
and because I'm right-handed again I just&nbsp;
need to change the angle that I'm filleting

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.329
and there's the fourth
