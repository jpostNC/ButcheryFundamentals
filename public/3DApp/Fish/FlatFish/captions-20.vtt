00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.160
so the next thing we want to do is remove the&nbsp;
fillets now this has four fillets it has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.240
center bone it actually sticks up nice and high&nbsp;
so it makes it easy for it and if you look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.720
there's a line that you can follow right along&nbsp;
in here so the first thing that I want to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.160
cut right behind the head with a nice sharp&nbsp;
knife and go right down to that center bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.560
then if you see the center bone I want to actually&nbsp;
score it so I can see where I'm cutting now this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.560
bone does tend to stick up so you want to get just&nbsp;
on one side of it and I usually go all the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.320
down with the tip of my knife, I have a bit of a flexible&nbsp;
knife, you also want to know where your hand is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.600
you want to keep your hand clear in case the knife&nbsp;
slips and sometimes with fish the knife can slip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:54.560
quite easily, so again I'm just going to slowly&nbsp;
with the tip of my knife start to remove the flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.160
now as you can see here because my knife is&nbsp;
flexible it's very easy to get down to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.240
bone here so I'm going down along the bone and i&nbsp;
like to continue to keep going all the way down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.560
when possible as you can see it's coming out&nbsp;
quite nicely and it's going along the bone line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.560
we're removing the fillet with the skin on&nbsp;
so we're not going to take the skin off until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.640
after when it gets down to the end here i&nbsp;
just want to continue to cut all the way along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.160
and then eventually we're going&nbsp;
to go right through the skin here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.840
and because our knife is nice and sharp it&nbsp;
should have no problem going all the way through
