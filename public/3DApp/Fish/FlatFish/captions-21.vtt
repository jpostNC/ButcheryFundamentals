00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.640
so now that i've removed one fillet I'm going&nbsp;
to flip the fish so I can get this second side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.000
because I'm right-handed I want to use my knife&nbsp;
the same in the same manner so remember that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400
center bone is nice and high in here so this&nbsp;
time I want to be on the left side of it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.520
the knife is an extension of my hand so I want&nbsp;
to make sure that I use that so I want to first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.760
score into here so I know where I'm going you want&nbsp;
to listen for those cuts remember I went along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.000
here and so I'm listening for those bones as I cut&nbsp;
this so again going right down to the bottom here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.280
and doing that as you can see nice long&nbsp;
cuts all the way up all the way up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
i'm just going to continue going all the&nbsp;
way through if there is any excess skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.240
i can always take this off after I just want&nbsp;
to get around and there it is right there

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:04.282
and like I said if there's any&nbsp;
excess skin we can easily trim it off
