00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.240
so now what we have is four fillets two from the&nbsp;
darker side and two from the lighter side the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.440
thing we need to do is remove the skin so in order&nbsp;
to remove the skin I like to turn the skin side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.680
down and get my knife just underneath and get some&nbsp;
of the skin loosened I like to use a paper towel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.520
or a dry towel whatever you have and you&nbsp;
want to just move both of them simultaneously in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.560
the opposite direction so that the skin just comes&nbsp;
off just like that so there's the skin I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.520
going to roll the skin up and I'm going to continue on&nbsp;
with the next one so again it's the same procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.680
i want to get my knife underneath not go through&nbsp;
the skin but I need to have enough skin to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.400
with either a paper towel or wet towel and then on&nbsp;
the edge of the board I want to make sure that i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.600
moving both the knife and the skin simultaneously&nbsp;
so what happens is then you get the skin that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
comes off just like this and again I'm just going&nbsp;
to roll the skin up and there's this two fillets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.680
i'm going to do the same thing with the other&nbsp;
side which again get my knife just underneath

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.800
and moving both the knife and the skin at&nbsp;
different times you can get the skin just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.120
like that and there's a third fillet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.360
and then the last one, so a nice sharp knife is&nbsp;
important to have and watching where your knife is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.240
and making sure that you are in control of&nbsp;
your knife all the time you always want to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.280
sure that you do all of the filleting at once&nbsp;
and all of the skinning all at the same time you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.134
just don't do one fish at a time you do them all&nbsp;
simultaneously and there you have the four fillets
