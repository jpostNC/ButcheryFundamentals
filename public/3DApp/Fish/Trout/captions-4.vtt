00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
so now we've removed the the backbone&nbsp;
let's just clean this up a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.760
bit so what I want to do is just do is go&nbsp;
along the top here with a very sharp knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.240
and just trim this off as you can see keep it nice&nbsp;
and neat keep your area nice and clean and as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.480
always keep your knife pointing away from your&nbsp;
fish so that way you don't hit your fingers on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.240
so now I want to remove the rib cage so the way&nbsp;
i do this is you've got to be very careful nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.200
sharp knife and you want to go just underneath&nbsp;
the rib cage once you go under you're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.400
go towards your hand very gently but the bones&nbsp;
are in between so I'm using the tip of my knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.480
and just gently scoring to get it as you can&nbsp;
see I'm just checking each time I go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.519
and coming towards my hand and lifting up so you&nbsp;
can see how it's just coming along go all the way

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.800
now a lot of times people will just cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.840
straight down I just want to get&nbsp;
this last red bone that I missed
