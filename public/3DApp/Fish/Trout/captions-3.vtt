00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.720
so now we have the backbone exposed on this&nbsp;
side I'm going to flip the fish over and do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.120
the same on the opposite side now don't worry&nbsp;
if you leave a little bit of meat on the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.760
because we'll get that later so what I want to&nbsp;
do again is go down to the backbone and while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.040
i'm going along on my knife I want you to think of&nbsp;
having your knife and applying the pressure this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.280
way as you go through so that's exactly what&nbsp;
i'm going to do along here is having a knife

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.480
going all the way down and just&nbsp;
gently do that watch your hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.520
you want to make sure that you follow all the&nbsp;
way along and then when I get to the end i'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.000
just turn it over and just trim it and so now&nbsp;
i have all of the bones as I showed you before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.640
with the back one on each side I will scrape that&nbsp;
off after any time you come to where the fins are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.040
you'll notice that there's bones inside as&nbsp;
well as the outside where the fin would be
