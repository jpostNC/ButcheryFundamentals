00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.520
okay so now the next job we need to do is remove&nbsp;
the skin so we're gonna go from the tail to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.960
head and the way we do this is we put our knife&nbsp;
right down to the flesh and we simultaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.080
move the flesh and move the knife at the same time&nbsp;
all the way up trying to keep all the flesh intact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.840
and none of it on the skin so let's go ahead and&nbsp;
try now because of my knife and my knuckles I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160
to do this over the edge of the table so we're&nbsp;
just going to start we tend to lose a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.360
of flesh here just in the end but I need to grab&nbsp;
something and I like to use a paper towel here so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.000
what I want to do is get the paper towel in and&nbsp;
again like I said get a good grip and then both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.960
of these should be moving just nice and smooth&nbsp;
just like butter and as I'm moving them both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.560
you're going to see it just goes right to the end&nbsp;
so when I pull this away this should show that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.680
of the skin is right here and there's absolutely&nbsp;
no flesh on it right from the tail to the head
