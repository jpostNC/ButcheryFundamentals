00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
the next stage that we have to do&nbsp;
is to remove the pin bones here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.760
so you can see the pin bones are sticking up&nbsp;
a lot of times you cannot see the pin bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.680
but you can feel them so if you just use your&nbsp;
finger and pull back you can actually feel them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.920
so what you do is you grab a pair of tweezers&nbsp;
and you grab each one of them and pull them out

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.520
so I have a little bowl of water that i've kept&nbsp;
and what I want to do is just stick my tweezers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.520
in and I'm just going to dip this into some water&nbsp;
so I can get each one of them so again it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.480
direction of which way it's coming out so you want&nbsp;
to look for those pin bones and if you see if i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.600
just push it they stick out and once I see them&nbsp;
sticking out I can just grab them just like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.440
and it's very delicate and you want&nbsp;
to be very delicate with the fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.120
and you want to keep it as fresh&nbsp;
as possible so you want to do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.680
reasonably quick you don't want to have&nbsp;
your fish sitting at room temperature

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.640
if you miss one you can easily just rub your&nbsp;
finger down and feel the ones that you've missed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.760
sometimes you can't see them&nbsp;
but you can definitely feel them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.160
when people are quick at this fishmonger friends&nbsp;
of mine very fast at removing all of these they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.840
just pull them out like this and use your water&nbsp;
to dip your tweezers in to keep it nice and clean
