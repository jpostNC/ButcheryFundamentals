00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.520
so to fillet this there are a couple of ways&nbsp;
of doing it the way I'm going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.400
you is by removing the head so I want to&nbsp;
get as much of the flesh behind the gill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.840
so that I'm not wasting it so what&nbsp;
i'll do is i'll put my knife behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.920
just to find the spot and then cut&nbsp;
the head off completely right here

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.920
okay so now that the head is removed what we&nbsp;
want to do is we want to look at the spine here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.120
and this is the backbone of the fish so what we&nbsp;
really want to do is get our knife to go inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.440
we're going to have the backbone as our guide and&nbsp;
so we're going to be putting a little force on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.040
knife as we go through our fish when we fillet so&nbsp;
let me start the first thing I want to do is cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.760
along this backbone and what I'm doing is cutting&nbsp;
the ribs as you can see the inside of the ribs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.880
here and this is the backbone that I'm going to&nbsp;
rest my knife on and then slowly using a sawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.840
action but applying a small amount of pressure&nbsp;
with the back of my knife just to follow through

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.840
and then when I remove it you should be able&nbsp;
to see the backbone all the way along here
