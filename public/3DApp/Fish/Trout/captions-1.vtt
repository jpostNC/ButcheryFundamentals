Welcome to The Fundamentals of Butchery.

2
00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:04.004
I'm Chef David Wolfman
from George Brown College.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.240
Today, it's all about fish.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.642
So what we have
here is a farm raised trout.

5
00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.144
Very sustainable.

6
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.513
When you're looking for trout,
you want to look for freshness.

7
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.615
You want to make sure
that the flesh bounces back.

8
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.151
You want to have that shocked
look in the eye.

9
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.587
We want to make sure that the gills
are nice and red.

10
00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.390
These gills have been taken out
because this is the way they come

11
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.159
when you order them
and all of the fins have been removed.

12
00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.095
You also want to make sure
that it's got that fresh smell.

13
00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.433
Now, when it comes in, it might have a bit
of a slimy texture to it, which is okay.

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.405
It should have a fresh sea smell,
not a fishy smell to it.

15
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.041
And then when you get it,
when you're working with it,

16
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.178
you want to make sure that you pat it dry
to get rid of that bit of slime.

17
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:49.182
That's because you want to make sure
that it's safe to fillet it

18
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.454
The other thing is, when we're actually
filleting this, this has two filets to it.

19
00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.756
So this is known as a round fish.

20
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.726
So there's two filets, one on
the left side and one on the right side.

21
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.829
And we're going to take you through
all the process of taking it apart.
