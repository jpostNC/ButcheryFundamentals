00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.080
so here we have a beautiful halibut as you can&nbsp;
see it's it's got the dark side right here which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.440
is like a camouflage and a white side underneath&nbsp;
there's four fillets here so there is a side bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.880
that sticks up which separates the two fillets&nbsp;
on each side we also have a collarbone now we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.800
going to cut this collarbone off I'm going&nbsp;
to need two different knives to do it so i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.960
going to use my fillet knife boning knife here&nbsp;
to loosen it and I'm going to turn it over and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.360
then i'll use my french knife to take off&nbsp;
the rest so I just want to go underneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.840
just using the tip of my knife here and just&nbsp;
score all the way through it's like a crescent

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.720
and I'm going to do the same thing on the&nbsp;
opposite side so let's just flip the fish over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.760
you want to be careful when&nbsp;
you're flipping the fish over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.120
and also have a keep a nice clean side towel to&nbsp;
keep it nice and dry you want to keep it safe the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.520
same like handling your knife you want to make&nbsp;
sure that the handle of your knife is also dry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.120
so it's the same thing on this side now&nbsp;
there is two fillets there's one here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:23.006
and one here which we'll get to in a in a&nbsp;
minute so again we want to remove the collar

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.480
once we get to this part then we will&nbsp;
need our french knife to go through

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.160
so again the sharper knife will&nbsp;
go right through the backbone

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760
let me just expose it so you can see it&nbsp;
better so you can see there's the backbone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080
right there so i've gone through on one side&nbsp;
and i'll flip it over to go on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.120
actually I didn't need to flip it&nbsp;
it just came out just like that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.053
and there's the collar
