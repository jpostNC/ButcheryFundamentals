00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.720
so i've removed the collarbone now&nbsp;
whitefish bones make a better stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.240
as opposed to fatty fish like salmon so i&nbsp;
prefer halibut it makes a really nice stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.760
let me just flip this over and then we'll start&nbsp;
with the other side to fillet it, so again you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.920
make sure that the fish is not slippery by using&nbsp;
a clean towel and then we're just going to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.120
our knife and score all the way down the center&nbsp;
so I start at the bottom because I'm right-handed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.040
so I want to score all the way along the&nbsp;
center up to the top now remember that the side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.160
bone sticks out so that separates both&nbsp;
fillets so I just want to go all the way along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.240
and I'm just going to follow so again going all&nbsp;
the way one note long nice stroke when possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.840
make sure the skin is cut the skin is pretty&nbsp;
tough so your knife has to be nice and sharp

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.920
and you just want to follow&nbsp;
this all the way along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.840
again nice scoop all the way along you&nbsp;
can see it's starting to lift up here

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480
and continuing it again all the way through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.656
if there is any excess skin on&nbsp;
there we can remove it after

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.840
now just one more cut should&nbsp;
clean it completely here
