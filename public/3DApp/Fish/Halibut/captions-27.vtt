00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.400
so now we can see that it's exposed&nbsp;
the center bone so what I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.920
do is just get on top of that but also&nbsp;
get underneath right up to the top here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.840
i'm just going to score right down the center

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.400
nice long strokes all along the bone you want&nbsp;
to listen for that bone I'm going to flip the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.560
fish so I can get this second side because&nbsp;
i'm right-handed I want to use my knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.880
the same in the same manner so remember that&nbsp;
that center bone is nice and high in here so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.120
this time I want to be on the left side&nbsp;
of it and the knife is an extension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.840
of my hand so I want to make sure that I use that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.840
and like I said if there's any&nbsp;
excess skin we can easily trim it out
