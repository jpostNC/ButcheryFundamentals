00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
so the next thing we want to do is&nbsp;
portion it I have a digital scale that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.120
wrapped in saran wrap to keep it nice and clean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.240
and so I'm going to use my knife and pull it&nbsp;
nice and through you want to also make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.200
that the flesh is nice and fresh as you can&nbsp;
see here getting even sized portions as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.880
get farther down we can check them on the scale&nbsp;
to make sure that they're all the same weight

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.400
and as you get further down to the bottom

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.440
you could just cut this portion halfway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.840
fold it underneath so that they're all&nbsp;
generally the same weight there we go
