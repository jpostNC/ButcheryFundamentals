<p><b><span class="bblue">Backbone:</span></b> the vertebrae or spine of an animal </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Diaphragm:</span></b> A muscle located in the belly portion of the animal, often referred as the skirt steaks in retail cuts. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Eviscerated:</span></b> refers to an animal or fish that has had their internal organs removed. It is important that this process is done as soon as possible after slaughter to prevent the organs from spoiling the muscles. Removing the organs also assists in cooling the carcass.  Cooling is imperative to get the carcass out of the danger zone before harmful bacteria can breed. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Ribs:</span></b> A fabricated meat cut, usually associated with pork, but can also refer to beef or lamb. Is usually the most expensive cut of pork. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Skirt Steak:</span></b> Located on the inside of the abdomen wall just below the ribs, skirt steak can be either of two long, flat, well-marbled muscles: the diaphragm and the abdominal muscle. A little rough to look at, skirt steaks are versatile and full of flavor. </p>
<p><b><span class="bblue">Tenderloin:</span></b> The most tender cut on any animal. On 4 legged animals the tenderloin muscle starts at the ribs and runs into the leg. It is connected to the primal loin cut of beef and pork and the primal saddle cut of lamb. </p>
