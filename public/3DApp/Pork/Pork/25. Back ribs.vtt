00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.802
The last thing I want to do to the rack

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.473
is get it to the point
where I can make it into a back rib

3
00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.276
We made the side ribs off the belly
so we can look at how the two compare.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.714
So the first thing I need to do is I need
to take the handsaw and I need to chine

5
00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.051
ah sorry, remove the chine bone
from the rack itself.

6
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.855
So this would be considered
the chine bone here with the rib meets

7
00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.291
in with the backbone of this bone
structure here is called the chine bone.

8
00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.161
So I need to identify
where I want to make that cut.

9
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:32.832
For me, I'll actually market
sometimes with a knife where we can see

10
00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:36.036
these rib bones almost kind of round out
at the base of them.

11
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.974
I'm using those round bones
to kind of make a knife mark along

12
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.845
almost right
through the roundest part at the base. OK,

13
00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:50.150
and then I can take my saw
and I'm just going to be following

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.253
along that mark.

15
00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:57.257
Like so, once I'm through,

16
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.660
I don't want to be damaging the loin.

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.264
And this is something very familiar
to those who have worked with Lamb

18
00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.265
as well, too.

19
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.668
If they don't have the luxury of a band
saw can be a little bit tricky

20
00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.136
to get in there.

21
00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.806
So I don't want to cut too, too
deep and damage that loin.

22
00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:16.743
So I will just use my knife
to kind of break through where I can.

23
00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:21.681
OK, so now I've got that
and leave it intact,

24
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.585
because it provides me with more stability
when I'm making my back ribs.

25
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.855
So now this is where
we're going to be making our back ribs.

26
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.591
I'll take the knife in that reverse
grip again.

27
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.762
And I just need to kind of be again,
fully aware of how much meat I'm leaving

28
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.032
on the back ribs while not wanting to take
too much away from the rack itself.

29
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:42.402
So my first cut is actually going
to be tight to the bone.

30
00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.673
And there's this muscle right here
called the secondary muscle in the eye.

31
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.542
That's the muscle that I'm looking for.
So again, tight to the bone,

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.445
and I'll follow it through

33
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.883
until I come in contact with that
secondary eye.

34
00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.386
Which is right

35
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.323
there when we open it up.

36
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.259
Now this cut is going to be
the most important

37
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.461
because this is
what I'm actually going into the loin.

38
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.598
So I want to make sure that I'm leaving
some good coverage of loin meat

39
00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.967
on those back ribs as I come down.

40
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:19.439
And make the cut to remove the back ribs.

41
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.309
I can come through and pull that back rib

42
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.646
right out
from where I made the cut with the chine.

43
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:31.084
And now we've got our back ribs, OK.

44
00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.521
Now, the last thing to do
is remove this backbone.

45
00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.391
And I just follow it with my knife

46
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:44.164
like so, and remove that.

47
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.637
So I've got my boneless loin
or boneless rack and my back ribs.
