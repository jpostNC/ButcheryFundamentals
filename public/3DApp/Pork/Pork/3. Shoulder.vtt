1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.535
So now we're
going to take off the front shoulder,

2
00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:07.107
and I think I should preface this
by saying that you can break down a pig

3
00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:11.111
literally a million different ways
culturally specific, regionally specific.

4
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.914
There's so many different ways
to do this for the purposes of today,

5
00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.917
we're going to get it down
into whatever would be traditional,

6
00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.420
traditionally
recognized North American cuts.

7
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.123
So for our purposes today,

8
00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.793
I like to butcher the shoulder
between the fourth and the fifth rib.

9
00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.029
You can butcher it between any rib.

10
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.899
No one is holding you
to any accountability in that sake.

11
00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.170
This is the way that I was taught
because between the fourth and fifth rib,

12
00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.706
we'll see on the other side
when we flip the animal

13
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.010
that will actually bypass the shoulder
blade, which makes for a lot more easy

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.280
cutting bringing our knife through
so we totally bypass the shoulder blade

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.750
and then we can maximize those pork chops
that we'll get to later on in the videos.

16
00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.485
That being said.

17
00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.756
What I like to do is I have to identify
where the very first rib is

18
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.292
and sometimes it's hidden in here,
there's a little bit of fat here,

19
00:00:59.292 --> 00:00:59.926
so I have to

20
00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:03.396
just kind of feel around with my finger
and identify where number one, number two,

21
00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.633
number three and number four
is between the fourth

22
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.867
and fifth
is where I'm going to want to go.

23
00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.336
So I'll grab my boning knife

24
00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.039
and I'm going to use a reverse grip
or a pistol grip

25
00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.943
and just going to come through
and I can go right down to the tabletop.

26
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.514
So once I get there,
I pull my knife all the way through.

27
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.951
If you're lucky enough,
you can get right through the chest plate,

28
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.220
which is mostly cartilage,
so a knife can come through it.

29
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.123
What's not going to happen
is me slipping the knife around

30
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.026
and getting it through this section here
because we have this whole backbone .

31
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.329
So what I need to do is
I just need to make a marker between

32
00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.066
the fourth and fifth disc
in that vertebrae, and I just bring my

33
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.668
knife up just to make a cut.

34
00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.003
Now I'm going to get

35
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:48.408
the hand saw
and make a cut through the backbone.

36
00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:53.513
It won't take much with the sharp hand saw
and not putting in a lot of pressure,

37
00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.850
I'm easily able to go right through.

38
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.085
Then grabbed my steak knife

39
00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.055
or Scimitar, and I'm going to finish off
this cut in one fell swoop.

40
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.758
Or at least that's the plan,
so I can get through that shoulder blade.

41
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.495
Pull it through.

42
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.231
Now what I've got is the front shoulder
removed.

43
00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.134
And for me, this is really where
the rubber meets the road as far

44
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.837
as seeing the quality of the animal and.

45
00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.708
For those less initiated,
you may not recognize

46
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:26.212
where the quality comes from,
but I look at the marbling in the muscle

47
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.914
and between the muscles,

48
00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.784
and I'm also looking at the difference in
color of the different muscles here too.

49
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:35.455
And the amount of back fat
this one really does tick all the marks.

50
00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:40.193
It is an extraordinary amount
of marbling in the eye

51
00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:44.364
again, as well as between the muscles
and just a generous amount of back fat.
