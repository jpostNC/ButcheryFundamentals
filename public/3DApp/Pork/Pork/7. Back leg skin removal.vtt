00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.671
So we've got the back hip of the animal,
we've removed the trotter and the hawk.

2
00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.040
And now what we're going to do
is we're going to prepare the back

3
00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.577
hip for boning and getting it
into its larger muscle groups.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.647
first, I need to remove a couple of
things, one being the tailbone here

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.116
and the other being the skin.

6
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.986
So just to take the tail off,
you see just a little bit of the remnants

7
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:20.954
of the tail right here.

8
00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.724
That's just something that will make
skinning it infinitely more easy.

9
00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:25.558
So what I'm gonna do

10
00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:29.462
is I'll just come underneath the tailbone
and I'll just cut it off.

11
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.665
But in such a fashion
that I'm not taking any usable meat

12
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.900
with it, a little bit of fat.

13
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.103
Never hurt anybody come off so well.

14
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.538
Discard that.

15
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.440
And then what we're going to do
is we're going to skin it.

16
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.742
So when I'm skinning the back hip.

17
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.481
I like to come underneath the skin
here, it's a thinner skin

18
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.618
so I can come underneath the
that I choose not to go into the skin

19
00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.386
for fear of damaging the muscle
that's under it.

20
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.357
So I'll come under the skin
like so I'll turn my knife up, obviously

21
00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.160
not wanting to be too close to it
and I'll just make an incision.

22
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.797
From there, I'm going to be skinning it
in such a fashion that I don't want

23
00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.767
to give myself y'know awkward situations
where I can't see where my knife is.

24
00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.770
So I want to make sure that I have full
visibility of the blade at all times,

25
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.104
albeit it.

26
00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.573
It will be under the skin,
but you'll see what I mean.

27
00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:17.777
So on the inside round here,
which is this larger muscle, we have this

28
00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:23.616
almost looser fat also known as wet fat,
not something that is very desirable

29
00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.753
in very many applications
on the hip itself.

30
00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:29.456
But when we do flip it over
and we get into this section here,

31
00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:33.760
which is more of a continuation
of the back fat that certainly is usable.

32
00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.895
So what I would like to do
is when I'm skinning it,

33
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:39.499
I'll leave as much fat on the muscle
as possible , so to skin it.

34
00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:41.534
I like to

35
00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.671
keep my non knife hand
totally out of the equation

36
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.075
until I make a couple of incisions
so that I can get my hands on the skin.

37
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.111
I don't need to be underneath
with a sharp knife.

38
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.912
The knife goes right through that skin way

39
00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.414
too easy,
and I don't want it to go through mine.

40
00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:59.752
So I just take some slack and I just start
removing some of that loose fat.

41
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:03.356
And like I said, this wet fat here,
if it comes off of the skin,

42
00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.557
that's not a big deal.

43
00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:08.361
So as I said before,
I'm going to flip it over,

44
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.631
but I want to make sure that I'm
leaving a little bit of this back

45
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.201
fat on the back leg itself.

46
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.939
OK, so we can pull it and
we can try to leave some of it on there.

47
00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.044
But what I want to be doing is making
long, fluid passes instead of coming at it

48
00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.848
with little knicks.

49
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.953
So I can make long, fluid strokes like so.

50
00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.359
I'm just trying to remove
as much of that skin as possible

51
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.128
while leaving some of that back
fat as well.

52
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.865
So I'll come underneath
and then I'll flip it over.

53
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.102
And just remove any skin that's left.

54
00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.973
So I've got my skin

55
00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.676
there removed from the back leg.
