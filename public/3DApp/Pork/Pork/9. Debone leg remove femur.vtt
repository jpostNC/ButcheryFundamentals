00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.901
So we've removed the aitch bone,

2
00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.738
and now our last bone to come on
is going to be the femur bone.

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.342
So I look for the separation between
the muscles because I'm really all about

4
00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:13.446
preserving the integrity of the muscles
for utilization in our next steps.

5
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:18.351
So what I'm looking for
is the seam between the sirloin tip

6
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.589
or the knuckle and the inside round,
so that seam exists right here.

7
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.857
And wouldn't you know it

8
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.293
just so happens to coincide with the femur
bone being directly under it,

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.864
so it becomes kind of a fairly easy cut,
but you certainly want to be looking

10
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.633
for that seam and we'll look for it
when we make the cut.

11
00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.504
So where I took the hawk off,
I'm going to just be using my knife

12
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.907
on the left side of that to begin
with being a right handed person.

13
00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.976
So I'm just going to come down
just deep enough

14
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.579
that I'm on the other side of that joint
where we took off the hawk.

15
00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.649
I don't want to be so deep
that I'm going to be affecting

16
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.251
the muscles that are underneath of it,

17
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.887
and I don't want to be so shallow
that I skip over the bone

18
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.688
and cut all the way
through the sirloin tip.

19
00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.591
two things I don't want to do, so I'll
just be kind of aware of those two things.

20
00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.595
And when I'm looking for again,
is the seam between the muscles.

21
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.167
And we can find that seam exists right
here.

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.470
We'll see a vein in here and a little bit
of the silver skin in this section here.

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.706
So now having pulled that muscle back, I'm

24
00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:17.277
just going to continue to pull that inside
round just a little bit further.

25
00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.080
So I just use that pistol grip again
and I reverse grip

26
00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.116
and I'm just going to seam my inside
round.

27
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.519
Just back, just a little bit,
we'll get into actually pulling the muscle

28
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.456
all the way out in just a second,
so it's just kind of out of the equation.

29
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.990
I won't be damaging this muscle.

30
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.493
So what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to turn it around now

31
00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.329
and I'm going to be removing the sirloin
tip now from the bone.

32
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.066
So when I come in with a reverse grip,
what I'm aiming for

33
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.268
is to minimize the amount of meat
that's on the bone.

34
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.304
So I'm just going to use my knife
to make sure I hit

35
00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.007
in the same area that I removed the inside
round with my first cut.

36
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.042
So I'll just kind of angle

37
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.145
my knife in such a fashion
that there's no meat on the bone

38
00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.481
and I can just use the tip of my knife
to come around.

39
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:59.185
What I'm doing is opening up the meat
around the femur bone like a book.

40
00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.721
For lack of a better term.

41
00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.724
So I'm just going to come in now
and I need to remove around

42
00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.126
the head of the femur bone.

43
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.395
There's just a little bit of meat here,
so I'll just come across like so

44
00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.898
cut the bone away from the meat.

45
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.069
So I've got the femur bone out,

46
00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.272
one last bone to come out,
which is going to be the patella,

47
00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:23.810
the kneecap here, and I can literally
just run my knife around it.

48
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.579
And remove the kneecap as well.
