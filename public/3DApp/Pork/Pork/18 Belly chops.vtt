00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.702
We've got our pork belly,

2
00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:06.873
you know, as famously known as bacon,
but we have to get it to that point.

3
00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:09.542
So there are a few different things
to talk about before we get to that point.

4
00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.580
So one being is that not
all parts of the belly are created equal.

5
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.017
The muscle structure
certainly changes around the end,

6
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.551
where it meets up with the leg.

7
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.122
We've got for, you know,

8
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.123
anatomy purposes.

9
00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.493
We've got our flank steak in here
and our bavette here.

10
00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.629
But what I'm more concerned about
is actually these two muscles here,

11
00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.598
which are the one diaphragm muscle.

12
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.333
And then we've got our outside skirt,

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.535
which would be this one here
our inside skirt sorry.

14
00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.271
So inside skirt, outside skirt

15
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.274
or diaphragm muscle,
I actually use these ones as my markers.

16
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.309
So I'm using this inside skirt
as my marker.

17
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:48.581
Where the inside skirt ends is where
I like to actually square off the belly

18
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.819
because again,
it starts to really change in structure.

19
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.921
We see a lot more separation of muscles.

20
00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.892
We see glands in here again
that we would want to remove.

21
00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.894
So this actually gets trimmed out again.

22
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.129
Our flank steak here our bavette here.

23
00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.265
This actually gets trimmed out
and used for mince.

24
00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.233
So that's that part of it.

25
00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:08.635
I'm going to

26
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:12.739
start by removing this skirt steak
or diaphragm muscle here,

27
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.975
so how I like to do
that is like to lay my knife

28
00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.080
flat on the bone and use that as my guide,
and I'm just going to run

29
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.782
my knife underneath the skirt steak
like so.

30
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.920
And I remove it.

31
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.791
And this could be saved for a skirt steak,
I suppose if you had a few,

32
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.759
you could make a sandwich,

33
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.861
but normally they would find its way
into the mince meat.

34
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.298
Now we're we're left

35
00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.101
with is a bone in belly square cut

36
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.938
could use the whole thing for bacon,
but again, we'll get to that point.

37
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.773
first thing I want to do
is actually demonstrate

38
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.243
a couple of these bone in belly chops,
which are quite nice.

39
00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.780
So I'm going to take off a couple
where we took off the shoulder.

40
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.714
So I'll turn it around

41
00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.117
and I'm

42
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.353
literally just going right
between the bones

43
00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.889
and I'm going to go right through.

44
00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:09.129
And we make these very majestical

45
00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.067
bone in belly chops,

46
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.736
which can be braised.

47
00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:17.937
Barbecue.

48
00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.672
Slow roasted.

49
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.575
You know, the possibilities are endless,
but it's just that nice

50
00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:26.846
meat to fat ratio that you get
that makes these such a stunning chop.
