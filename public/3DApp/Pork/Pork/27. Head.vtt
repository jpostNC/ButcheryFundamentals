00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.770
We've got the
pig's head, and we're going to talk about

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.240
all of the different opportunities in here
because there are many.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.111
One application when the pig head is whole

4
00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.515
is masking it, is what they call it
when they actually debone it

5
00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:21.621
and we would start under this section here
and find out where the cheekbone is.

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.224
And we would start
making our cuts under here

7
00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.961
following it around
and boning the whole head out.

8
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.231
I would strongly advise
that you take your time

9
00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.434
and again be very cognizant
of where your knife is in relation

10
00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.203
to your hand because there is a lot of ins
and outs and crevices to look for

11
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.572
for our applications today .

12
00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.374
What we're going to do
is we're going to remove an ear

13
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.811
and we're going to remove one of the jowls
with the cheek on.

14
00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.815
So for the ear,
I'll just like to come through

15
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.918
at the base of the ear
and run my knife down like so.

16
00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.888
And with the ear,
we can do a few different things

17
00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.957
thoroughly cleaning it is a good option.

18
00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.894
And then either poaching it,

19
00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.164
braising it or deep frying it all options.

20
00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.766
I've had them deep fried
before where they're sliced thin

21
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.135
and put on a pig's salad.
It was quite delicious.

22
00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.572
And now I want to do is
I want to take off the cheek or sorry,

23
00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.341
the jowl with the cheek included
and I'm looking for

24
00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.144
what I like to call the smile lines.

25
00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.481
I don't know if that's appropriate or not,
but we've got this crease here

26
00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:24.684
and I'd like to follow it up right
underneath the ear.

27
00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.051
Like so.

28
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.189
So I'm going to come in
and I'm just going to bring my knife like,

29
00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.358
so I want to be right on
top of that cheekbone

30
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:37.831
in order to maximize the amount of meat
that I'm taking off with that cheek.

31
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.468
So the cheekbone is flat,
so once I find it,

32
00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.603
I can just run my knife on it

33
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.974
and make sure that I'm taking off
as much of that

34
00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:52.445
cheek and jowl as possible,
so I've come around

35
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.215
and that really is all the bone resistance

36
00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.450
that you're going to find
is that cheekbone.

37
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.721
So once we get around it,
we can then work on removing

38
00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.891
the whole cheek itself.

39
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.661
So I will cut down
until I see where it separates

40
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.932
and there's no more glands
then I run my knife right along top.

41
00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.670
I remove all of them.

42
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.542
And the same thing
is going to happen on the other side

43
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.546
because we still see some glands in here
too, so I'm going to come in

44
00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:32.652
and remove all of these all the way down.
