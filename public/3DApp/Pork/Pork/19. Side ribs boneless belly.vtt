00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.068
So after we've taken off a couple of belly
chops, now,

2
00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.304
what we're going to do
is we're going to remove the side ribs.

3
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.942
Side ribs are simply an extension
of the back ribs off the loin,

4
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.911
and we decided where we wanted

5
00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.949
to break off the belly from the loin,
which would determine the length

6
00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.085
or the size of the side ribs
and the size of the back ribs.

7
00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.454
So again, each cut affecting the other.

8
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.656
This is what we ended up for side ribs.

9
00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:27.127
So when we're taking off our side ribs
it is a very delicate balance

10
00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.229
because we don't want to take off
so much meat

11
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.232
that we're minimizing the amount
that we have on the belly .

12
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.402
And we don't want to take off so little
that we have no meat on the side rib

13
00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.438
or the spare ribs
So just a bit of a delicate dance.

14
00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:42.909
So what I like to do is I'll be very,

15
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.046
kind of involved in this cut.

16
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.182
I just want to come in with my knife
and I'm going to be running it,

17
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:53.286
the legs underneath the ribs, so this is
going to allow me to kind of monitor

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.424
the amount of meat that I'm leaving
on the ribs themselves and I'll run

19
00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.194
my thumb under just to kind of monitor
my progress as I'm coming through

20
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.600
. And I'll remove my side ribs like so

21
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.571
and then what I can do is I'm using
this skirt steak again of this diaphragm

22
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.908
muscle as my marker because this is where
I want to run my knife under there.

23
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.110
It's cartilage under here
so I can get my knife

24
00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:21.047
and just come under
and remove the side ribs like so .

25
00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:25.852
OK, so we've got our side ribs. OK,

26
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.589
now what we've got is

27
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.391
there's still a little bit
of the cartilage in here

28
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.360
and I'm going to go ahead and remove that
before we start talking about the bacon.

29
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.429
So I'm just going to come under this skirt
steak here

30
00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.066
and I'm going to run my knife.

31
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.634
Under it to separate it

32
00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:45.205
from that cartilage that I can pretty much
just pull right out like so

33
00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.809
so that cartilage has been removed
now is a totally boneless piece.

34
00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:54.547
So now we get a good look
at what would traditionally

35
00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.950
be known as bacon, right.
But before it becomes bacon,

36
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.452
it needs to be cured
and it needs to be smoked.
