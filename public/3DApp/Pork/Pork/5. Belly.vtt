00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.137
What we're going to do now is we're going
to be separating the belly section

2
00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:08.375
from the loin section
when I separate the belly from the loin.

3
00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:12.445
I need to be aware of I'm getting two
different types of ribs out of this.

4
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.480
We're getting our side ribs

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.549
that sit on top of the belly and we'd
get our back ribs off of the loin.

6
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.220
So what I like to do is I'll come in
roughly

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.790
about an inch and a half down
from where my ribs meet my back bone

8
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.360
and I'll either go two fingers or again,
roughly about an inch and a half.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.463
So I'll make a mark in this section here.

10
00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.931
So I just make a mark.

11
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.434
Then what I want to do is I'm going
to come down to the opposite end

12
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.337
and I'm going to identify
where my tenderloin is

13
00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.006
and that's this long muscle here.

14
00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.877
So once I see where my tenderloin is,
obviously

15
00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.812
I want to preserve
that as best as possible.

16
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.415
So I'm actually going to come down roughly
from where the tenderloin ends.

17
00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.483
I'll come down
roughly about an inch or so.

18
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.851
And then I make a mark.

19
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.788
So now I've got two different marks
to work with.

20
00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.458
Now I have to try as best as possible
without breaking out a meter stick

21
00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:01.227
to trace that line
to make a nice even cut.

22
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.830
So I'll just drag my knife along

23
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.100
and hit that mark.

24
00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.570
OK, now I've got a line to work
with as a guiding line.

25
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.206
So this muscle here, this
diaphragm muscle,

26
00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.309
they've cut it to eviscerate the animal.

27
00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.945
But this, if we were talking about beef,
would be a skirt steak.

28
00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.281
But for our purposes, for today,
we won't really worry about it.

29
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.550
So I'll just remove a bit of that
diaphragm muscle.

30
00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.453
And now I've gone.
I've got my line that I traced.

31
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.589
I'm going to go back to the reverse grip
and go right down

32
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.059
to the cutting board
to cut away this portion of the belly.

33
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.498
So that allows me to pull the belly away
because we talked about in the leg,

34
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.668
we want to make sure that all the muscle
is being cut by a knife.

35
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.970
And then I'll get the saw out
to cut the bone.

36
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.207
OK, so I'm just going to follow
that line that I traced out,

37
00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.642
you know, just start here.

38
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:53.947
And once I find a groove
I'll get my saw as horizontal as possible

39
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.416
and just keep on cutting those bones
until I'm through.

40
00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:58.418
That's it.

41
00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.920
I come back with my knife
in that reverse grip

42
00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.592
and now I can separate the belly

43
00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:07.760
from the loin.
