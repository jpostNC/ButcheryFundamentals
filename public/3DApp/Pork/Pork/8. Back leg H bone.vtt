1
00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.403
So now that the skin and the tailbone
have been removed,

2
00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:06.539
we're actually going to start working on
getting these bones out of here.

3
00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.575
So the first bone I'm going to take out

4
00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.978
is the aitch bone that we used as a marker
to remove the loin from the leg.

5
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.348
But on top of that aitch bone,
there's this muscle right here

6
00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.018
that's known as the oyster
or the spider steak.

7
00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.154
More specifically talking about beef,
but I'm sure that we can

8
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.558
we can coax it out and maybe get a couple
for a sandwich later on if we wanted to.

9
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.495
It just cradled
right in on top of that aitch bone.

10
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.930
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to follow the shape of that aitch bone.

11
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.300
And I'm just going to bring my knife under

12
00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.270
and remove it like so.

13
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.074
So as you can see, that aitch
bone has a bit of a curve to it.

14
00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.777
Truth be told,
the aitch bone is actually sitting mostly

15
00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.080
on like a 90 degree angle
cradled right on top of that femur bone.

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.383
So the femoral head of the bone is right
underneath this section here.

17
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.853
So I need to work this bone out this aitch
bone out

18
00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.990
by trying to obviously minimize
the amount of meat that comes off

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.894
with the bone and not damaging the muscles
that are around the aitch bone,

20
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.064
probably one of the trickier bones
to get out.

21
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.098
In all honesty.

22
00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:09.002
So how I'm going to do it is again,
I'll use my reverse grip

23
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.504
and I would like to trace out the bone
first and foremost.

24
00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.539
So I'll start up here.

25
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.544
I'll just bring it around like so.

26
00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.780
And by removing that oyster steak
or that spider steak,

27
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.283
that allows me to actually have
a better visual line of sight on it.

28
00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.318
So it kind of removes
a lot of the mystery.

29
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.686
We're trying to bone that out.

30
00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.256
So again, what we're seeing here
is how it's kind of cradled

31
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.958
right on top of that femur, right?

32
00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.895
So the femoral head being where it is,
there's actually a very strong tendon

33
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.397
that connects the two bones together.

34
00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.667
So I need to remove that before I can even
think about removing the aitch bone.

35
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.171
So what I like to do
is I'll pull that aitch bone like so

36
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.675
and I'll just get in there with the tip
of my knife and I'll remove it.

37
00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.410
So now the two have been separated.

38
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.679
Now I can actually start
fishing this bone out.

39
00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.683
So because my fingers are in such close
proximity to my boning knife,

40
00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.985
I just really want to be aware
of where my hand is

41
00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.020
as I'm making these cuts
because I'm going to be in there

42
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
with just the tip of my knife
so I can use this hole

43
00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.460
that's in the aitch bone
as a bit of leverage

44
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.863
so I can pull the bone away
as I'm cutting.

45
00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:14.067
So I just work my way around that cut
that the femoral head was in

46
00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.203
and I can just work that bone.

47
00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:20.940
So you'll see it does have a

48
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.309
little bit of a wonky shape to it
when it comes out.

49
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.913
There's a bit of a nub down here
for lack of a better term.

50
00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.184
The head of the femoral bone was in
and we've got the hole

51
00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.318
that we use for leverage.

52
00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.387
So there's our aitch bone being removed.
