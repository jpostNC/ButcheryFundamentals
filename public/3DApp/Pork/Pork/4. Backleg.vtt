00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:04.571
The next cut we're going to be
performing is taking the back leg off.

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.541
Often confused with preemptively
calling it a ham,

3
00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.078
a ham is when the actual leg is cured,

4
00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:15.215
so we're going to go with the raw name
and this is actually a back leg.

5
00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.452
So when I take off the back leg,
I'm looking for a marker and that marker

6
00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.755
is this bone right here
called the aitch bone.

7
00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:26.393
So I'm going to actually
leave the sirloin intact with the loin.

8
00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.728
So this is going to be broke,
maybe slightly different

9
00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.597
than some of the people break it,
but I always like

10
00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.866
to leave the sirloin intact
with the long loin itself.

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.036
So on this aitch bone, the marker I use,

12
00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.172
if I happen to be kind of blowing
through these things at a

13
00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.208
at a rapid pace is I'll go roughly
about an inch or a finger width.

14
00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.044
And alls I'm going to do is again.

15
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:44.844
Much like the shoulder,

16
00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.881
I'm just going to kind of mark
where I want to go with the saw

17
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.950
but I will be bringing my knife down
into this section here,

18
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.486
the lower section of the leg
and where we get into the sirloin

19
00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.223
tip in the belly section
and the flank is all boneless in here.

20
00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:02.095
So I can actually just bring my knife down
and I'll cut through all the way.

21
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.732
What that does for me
is I can pull the flesh apart,

22
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.469
use the hand saw
and I'm not tearing those muscle fibers.

23
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.972
We really want to be cognizant of the fact
when we're using the saw

24
00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.475
to just go through bone
the knife through flesh,

25
00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.678
we don't want to be tearing muscle fibers,
especially when we get into curing

26
00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:23.416
which the pig
is absolutely the best animal for curing.

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.589
We don't want shredded muscle tissue
for salt to maybe not get into.

28
00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.292
We want to make sure
we're having maximum coverage of salt,

29
00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.794
so we want to minimize
that bacterial growth scenario.

30
00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.498
So all that to say,
I've split apart the flesh with my knife.

31
00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.265
I can now come in.

32
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.834
I'm just cutting bones I want to keep.

33
00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.737
My saw as horizontal as possible
just to get through those bones, and

34
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:49.075
I just make a few passes until I'm through
and I can come in with my steak knife.

35
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.979
And again, with that reverse grip,
I can just bring it through

36
00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.281
all the way down to the cutting board.

37
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.619
And now I've removed the back leg.

38
00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.723
A couple of different things we'll talk
about when we get into the back leg is,

39
00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.959
you know, curing it for prosciutto,
et cetera,

40
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.596
but for breaking it down at its
primals We have our back leg.
