1
00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.336
This is our rack of pork.

2
00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:07.607
Many different options and opportunities
within this would be the equivalent

3
00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.744
to a prime rib, but
we would get a rack of pork out of this

4
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.214
for like a holiday meal
or some sort of occasional roast.

5
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.616
For our purposes today,

6
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.386
I want to demonstrate
getting some really nice

7
00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.156
rack chops out of it, and then we're going
to talk about back ribs.

8
00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.193
So the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to cut a couple of rack chops.

9
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.763
There's many different ways to do this.

10
00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.432
We could remove the chine bone,
which we will do for the back ribs.

11
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.467
However,
I like to leave the chine bone in.

12
00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.972
I like to knife cut the chops
and then I use a cleaver and a mallet

13
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.041
so we'll go through that whole process
right now.

14
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.977
OK, so first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to be going right

15
00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.012
in between these ribs.

16
00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.181
This section here
where we took off the shoulder, OK,

17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.716
so I'm just going to cut down.

18
00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.187
Right in between
and I want to be very aware of where

19
00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.823
I'm making my chops, so again,
we want to make sure that they're nice

20
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.261
and even chops so that we're getting
a nice even cook on it, right.

21
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.931
So then I take my cleaver and my mallet.

22
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.733
And I come down

23
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.669
and I cut

24
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.706
my bone in rack chops.
