00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:04.337
Move the back rib out of the way,
and we've got our boneless rack here,

2
00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.273
so what I want to do is I want to
square it up and get it ready for chops.

3
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.143
This what I call a tail piece here.

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.046
It really doesn't serve a purpose
in conjunction with this cut.

5
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.182
So I'm just going to take my steak knife
and remove it right

6
00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.185
at that start of that secondary eye so

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.923
this can be trimmed out
and used for sausage.

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.094
Matter of fact, we can just go
something like, so just run the knife

9
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.663
along the skin like so.

10
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.035
And that can be used
for any type of grind or sausage.

11
00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.672
So this now
what we've got our boneless rack

12
00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:43.510
now serves an opportunity
for us to do a chop.

13
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.079
So I'm just going to come in

14
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.148
and just do a nice sized job
so you can see.

15
00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:52.952
Now, we just come underneath

16
00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.221
and just take off the skin.

17
00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:59.592
And now we've got our boneless rack up

18
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.230
the cousin to a ribeye steak.
