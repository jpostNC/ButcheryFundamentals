00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.880
Hi I'm Juliette Orizetti from link farm&nbsp;
here in niagara on the lake and we're out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.920
here with our pigs in the forest, so our farming&nbsp;
philosophy really is based around our animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.480
when we started farming it was coming&nbsp;
from a background in animal welfare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:25.120
so our main goal is to raise our animals in an as&nbsp;
humane a way as possible while also respecting our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.880
farm so we want to be as sustainable and holistic&nbsp;
as we can, we've been raising pigs since 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.840
but we also have a large focus on grass-fed&nbsp;
sheep and we've started raising grass-fed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.560
beef as well in the last couple years and just&nbsp;
to round it out we have a flock of laying hens

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.360
so our sows are all purebred berkshires, they're&nbsp;
known as the kobe beef of pork and we're really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.440
not interested in any lean meats here so we really&nbsp;
want that marbling and then we crossbreed them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.840
with a duroc boar which is a more modern breed&nbsp;
but it has the most marbling of all the commercial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.720
pigs, well the pigs here they're omnivores like we&nbsp;
are so they need complete protein in their diet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.520
but they're also really great foragers so&nbsp;
they do eat a lot of grass in our pasture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.840
as well as nuts and roots and bugs that they&nbsp;
find on the ground but we of course have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.520
feed them as well they need complete protein and&nbsp;
the best source of protein for pigs is from grain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.800
so we feed a balanced diet of field peas&nbsp;
barley and oats, the the ratio sort of varies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.880
throughout the year but no soy no corn for our&nbsp;
pigs and of course we we add you know minerals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.360
and vitamins that they need to their diet and&nbsp;
then it sort of varies with the season so in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.840
fall of course they're getting seasonal&nbsp;
fruit and vegetables so lots of apples and pears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.200
donated from our customers and then in later&nbsp;
in the season they'll get lots of pumpkins but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.280
right now they're noshing pretty hard on the&nbsp;
acorns from our oak trees they live out here in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.640
a in an oak forest they've got about four acres&nbsp;
to forage from and that really makes our fall pork&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.040
quite special, my favorite cut is the blade steak so sometimes some people call it a butt chop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.440
i think that demeans it, so it comes from the&nbsp;
upper shoulder sort of neck area of the pig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.880
it's super marbled it's tender it's juicy,&nbsp;
it fools most people into thinking it's beef&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.360
and that doesn't get any better for me, by&nbsp;
supporting a small farmer you're supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.280
your local economy which is super important&nbsp;
i mean it makes my dreams come true right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.280
that's fantastic there's so many benefits like we&nbsp;
because we're a small farm and a small business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.360
we are also supporting another small farmer who&nbsp;
makes our grain mix for us he's a grain grower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.440
he's being supported, we also use a&nbsp;
small butcher, so that's a family-run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.320
business that's being supported rather&nbsp;
than you know a foreign-owned huge abattoir&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.440
what else, everything we support the local&nbsp;
cold storage company it really keeps everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.040
within you know a small radius none of that money&nbsp;
is leaving our local economy but also we

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.440
have the ability to be nimble in how we farm which&nbsp;
i think allows us to be very sustainable in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:45.520
of ecology so we we only raise 100 pigs a year&nbsp;
we're not doing it in an intensive way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.200
so we have a 15-acre forest here and by staying&nbsp;
small we're able to move our pigs through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.280
forest in a sustainable way so they're never in&nbsp;
one area for too long always moving so that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.280
save space for the wildlife and yeah just&nbsp;
everything we do we try to do in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.720
sustainable way, there's we don't have someone&nbsp;
dictating to us what the pigs need to be fed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.640
how we need to raise them so we can really make&nbsp;
choices with our conscience, so from from birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.440
they start at about two pounds of weight ,like i&nbsp;
said, but they grow super fast so by six months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.440
old on average they'll be at least 300 pounds live&nbsp;
weight which we aim for 300 to 350 pounds and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.640
that'll give us a pig that's 220 to 270 pounds&nbsp;
hanging weight and that's a lot bigger than your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.600
commercial pigs are going to be but we find that&nbsp;
it's really that last 50, at least 50&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.840
pounds where they put on that beautiful marbling&nbsp;
the intramuscular fat that makes it so special
