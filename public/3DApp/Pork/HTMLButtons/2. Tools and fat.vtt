00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.768
And now that we flipped over the carcass,

2
00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.471
we can start taking a look
at what's happening inside.

3
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.640
But first, before we get into that,
I think it's very helpful

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.843
to look at the tools
that I'll be using to get through it.

5
00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.713
Butcher shops can be equipped
with hundreds

6
00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:16.750
of thousands of dollars
worth of equipment for today's purposes.

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.153
And actually, truth be told,
for the majority of the work that I do

8
00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:24.557
as a butcher,
I use these minimal amounts of equipment.

9
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.460
I don't own a band saw self admittedly,
I have to admit that right now

10
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.630
anyway, what we will be
using is Old Faithful.

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.566
This is my bones saw a 20 inch bone saw.

12
00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:39.773
I'm using a ten inch scimitar
or steak knife.

13
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:45.612
And then the one that gets 99% of the work
is my six inch boning knife.

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.049
Looking at the interior of the carcass,

15
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.752
there's always two things that I'm looking
for immediately when I when I turn over

16
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:57.123
a pig carcass and both of those things
being A) that the kidney

17
00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.360
is still intact and that it actually has
a little bit of a slice in it.

18
00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.562
This is the inspectors
who stamp the outside of the carcass.

19
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.830
This is another way

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.566
that they're doing due diligence
to look at the health of the animal.

21
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.535
There is always going to be
a slice in the kidney.

22
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.037
They're just looking for a healthy color
to the kidney.

23
00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.340
That kidney will get removed.

24
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.844
I just take my knife and I just come under
and remove the kidney. OK.

25
00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.314
From there, I'm

26
00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.818
looking at the leaf
fat it's not always on the carcass,

27
00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.987
but it's always a pleasant surprise
when it is because it's so useful

28
00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.524
when the carcass is hot
and after it's been freshly eviscerated,

29
00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.961
this piece of fat
is laying on top of the belly. So

30
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.698
after the animal's been eviscerated,
what they'll do is they'll roll it

31
00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.768
and they'll pull it away from the carcass
and then let it hang.

32
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:46.039
So after an evening chilling overnight
in the fridge, it loses a bit of moisture.

33
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.441
And what happens is it becomes
a little bit more cylindrical in shape.

34
00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.246
All that to say, I like to
just pull it out with my hands like so

35
00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.882
and I pull it back towards the back leg
and it just comes right out.

36
00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.384
So the leaf fat

37
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.921
before the invention
of vegetable shortening.

38
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.493
This is a very, very clean and pure fat,
so it can be rendered down

39
00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.562
liquified, strained and into its pure form

40
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.665
and used as something
that you would be baking with.

41
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.870
So lard is what we call it
after it's been rendered down,

42
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.006
so something that we certainly want
to be keeping off the animal.
