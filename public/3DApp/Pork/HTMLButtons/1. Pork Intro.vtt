Hi, I'm Jamie Waldron.

2
00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.006
I'm a butcher and I've been a butcher
for about 20 years now.

3
00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:11.511
I've worked in almost every facet
of the industry from on small farms

4
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:16.616
with hundreds of lambs
to larger farms with thousands of pigs.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.720
I've worked in small and medium sized
abattoirs where we were processing about

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.990
50 lambs once a week to pig operations,

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.427
where we were butchering
and processing about 200 hogs a day.

8
00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.197
I've worked in restaurants
doing prep work.

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.366
I've worked with restaurants,
developing menus.

10
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.503
I've worked in wholesale
operations, retail operations.

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.205
I feel like it pretty much runs the gamut.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.742
I've pretty much had my hands
in all facets of the business

13
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.443
outside of the business.

14
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.611
I've wrote a book,

15
00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.814
so that enables me to speak
with a little bit of authority

16
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.184
or at least guide you through
what's happening today with an educated

17
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.686
mind on it. On Butchery.
