00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.103
We're
looking at the hind leg of the animal,

2
00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:07.207
and as I kind of talked about a little bit
before, it's it's a

3
00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:10.410
it's a leg until it's cured
and then it's a ham or smoked

4
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.047
at this state here,
we could certainly do a few things

5
00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:19.386
to make it into something
that's recognizable as prosciutto curable.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.356
We would take off this back tailbone
and this aitch bone as well,

7
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.358
but we want to actually dissect it

8
00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.427
and get it down
into its individual muscles today.

9
00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.530
So we're going to start by taking the back

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.566
trotter off
and then we'll take the back hawk off.

11
00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.702
So for the back trotter,

12
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:40.573
there's no easy way to kind of navigate
the joints with a knife.

13
00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.776
So what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go ahead and just use the saw.

14
00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:47.013
So I'm just looking back here for I'm
sure there's a fancy Latin name for it,

15
00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.350
but for my purposes today,
this will be the back ankle. OK.

16
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.653
So just above the back ankle, I'll
just take the saw and I don't really need

17
00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:58.058
to trace anything as long as I know
where I'm going with the saw.

18
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.293
And I just go through the bone.

19
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.130
I take my knife and just cut that off.

20
00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:08.301
So we've got our back trotter. OK.

21
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.905
And then I'm actually just going to use
my knife to navigate through the joint

22
00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.107
between the tibia and the femur.

23
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.977
And once I can isolate
where that joint is here

24
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.047
as my finger, it's a little bit deceiving
because where I can put my finger

25
00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:24.551
and where I can manipulate the joint, it's
actually a little bit higher than that.

26
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.786
So where I can manipulate it

27
00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.756
here, I'm actually
going to be aiming up in this area here

28
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.625
where I can find the joint
to go through with the knife,

29
00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.161
and I'm just going to use this reverse
grip again,

30
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.132
something that I feel very comfortable
with, and I'm going to be pulling it back

31
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.302
to separate this hawk from the inside
round here.

32
00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.704
So one of the things
that I need to be cognizant

33
00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.907
about is how much of this inside around
I want to be on the hawk.

34
00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:51.578
While I can totally appreciate the hawk
for what it is a great cut

35
00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:55.081
that can be slow roasted, smoked braised,
anything.

36
00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.852
I also don't want to minimize
the amount of inside round

37
00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.053
that will get to you in just a little bit.

38
00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.489
So I'm just going to go ahead
and just pull my knife through,

39
00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.326
and once I'm
through, I'll just need to come in again

40
00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:10.497
and navigate that joint that I identified,
and I can just remove

41
00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:15.368
the back hawk from the leg.
