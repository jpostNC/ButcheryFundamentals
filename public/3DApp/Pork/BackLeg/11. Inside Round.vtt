00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.769
This muscle here is the inside round

2
00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:07.774
when I'm boning out pork legs,
if I'm, you know,

3
00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.412
I'm short on sausage meat and normally
the whole back leg would go for sausage.

4
00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.116
However, for applications today
I do want to talk about

5
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.051
some of the particular uses
for some of these muscles.

6
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.588
So the inside round being a large,
solid muscle,

7
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.692
we can usually sorry
we can use it for schnitzel.

8
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.428
This is a great cut for getting those
those pork cutlets out of

9
00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.630
so we can clean it up
and get it to that point.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.501
So this is just a couple of things
I like to do before I start slicing.

11
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.237
one is
we talked about how the inside round

12
00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.672
has that almost wet fat on it
or that lose fat.

13
00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.007
So what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to come in

14
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.809
and I'm just going to take most of it off.

15
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.045
I don't really need it on here.

16
00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.348
It won't really cook
well with the type of application

17
00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.651
that we would use for schnitzel,
so I can remove a lot of that fat

18
00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.120
and then.

19
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.258
Very important
is they have a femoral artery.

20
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.025
I mean, we all do,

21
00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:02.362
but pigs also have a femoral artery,
so I like to remove that femoral artery.

22
00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.231
first, I got to identify where it is.

23
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.668
And you can see in this section here,
they'll generally be a little bit of like

24
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.003
remnants of blood in there.

25
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.840
So once I find the angle of the femoral

26
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.944
artery, I can just come in and cut
and we can see it

27
00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.947
right there, so I'm going to go ahead
and just remove that.

28
00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.452
I just kind of dig it out almost.

29
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.054
And once I remove it and take that out

30
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.592
now, I'm just going to almost
even out the cuts

31
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.262
and we'll save some trim that would
probably end up in mince or sausage.

32
00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.299
And now I can actually come in and start

33
00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.635
making some slices for my schnitzel.

34
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.304
And I just want to make again

35
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:48.341
nice large passes in order to get the most
surface area out of the schnitzel.

36
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:53.413
So I don't need to be too concerned about
how thick or thin they are at this point.

37
00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.115
A little bit thicker
actually is preferable

38
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.250
because what we'll be doing
is pounding it out.

39
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.987
So I'll just make a few cuts
and again, just to get it

40
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.891
nice large surface area.

41
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.331
So this would be our pork schnitzel.

42
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.399
Out of our inside round.
