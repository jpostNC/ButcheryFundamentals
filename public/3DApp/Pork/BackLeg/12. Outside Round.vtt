1
00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.770
This is our outside
round and our eye of round together.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.908
I know them as a gooseneck combined,
so we need to get it to a point

3
00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.110
where we can feel comfortable

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.413
trussing it and making it into a roast
that is uniform.

5
00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.016
However, we have a few muscles in here
that need to be removed

6
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.718
and can certainly go into trim
or any type of stew.

7
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.455
So the first one is
where we separated the back hawk.

8
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.691
So this is known as a heel muscle,

9
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.160
so I actually come in
and I'll just going to seam it out

10
00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.698
so I can just pull it and make the fascia
as I come through.

11
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.667
And now I've got this.

12
00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.772
That's a very tough, tough piece of meat
so cubed and used for stew.

13
00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.041
Really good application for that.

14
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.110
And then we've got this kind
of almost loose muscle right here

15
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.247
where we separated the back leg
from the loin section here.

16
00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.315
This would be actually be
part of the sirloin.

17
00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:52.752
So I'm just going to come in
and I'm going to again, just seam that

18
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.956
muscle out like so again, good for stew,
good for trim.

19
00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:02.195
So I've got the bones for pun, for the

20
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.598
the back leg roast of the eye of round
and the outside round,

21
00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.201
but I still need to cosmetically
clean it up a little bit.

22
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.637
I've got a little bit of this
loose stuff in here.

23
00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.705
This fat actually has a little bit
of white bone.

24
00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.543
That's where the tail was, so I'm going to
come in and just remove that.

25
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.912
Like so

26
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:23.783
and then I've also got this loose fat
that is sits just kind of cradled

27
00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.685
in between the eye fo round
and the outside round.

28
00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.855
So I want to find where it's sitting in.

29
00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:31.891
And also,

30
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.894
we've got a gland in here
that we want to remove, too, so.

31
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.097
And there also seems to be
a little bit of vein.

32
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.166
So all this fat is best to be removed.

33
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.403
Now we're pretty much ready to go.

34
00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.139
I'll flip it over and see where
we're sitting.

35
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.642
Fat tends to be a little bit heavier
when we took off the ham from the loins,

36
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.078
so I'm just going to thin out this fat
a little bit here.

37
00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.482
And again,
this is more considered the back fat.

38
00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.518
So this is really good fat
that I can add back in the sausages or I

39
00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.285
can render down.

40
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.989
Just remove a little bit of

41
00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.825
heavy fat to get it to that state there.

42
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.828
This roast can now be trussed up

43
00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.764
to keep it more uniform and dry roasted.

44
00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.501
Turns out quite nice, actually.
