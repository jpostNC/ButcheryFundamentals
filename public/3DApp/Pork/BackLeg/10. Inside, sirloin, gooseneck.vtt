1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.169
So the femur bone has been removed
and the kneecap, so what we're going to do

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.871
now is we're going
to we're going to separate

3
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:08.341
the the back leg into its three major
muscle groups.

4
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.309
So we've got our inside

5
00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.113
round, our gooseneck or our eye of round
and outside round together.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.849
And our sirloin tip or knuckle
section here.

7
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.553
So the seams are pretty easy to find after
you've done it a couple of times,

8
00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.022
but we'll just look for them now.

9
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.158
Once I actually can get my hands in here
and I'm separating the knuckle,

10
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.427
I can actually almost start pulling it
away.

11
00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.595
As you can see,

12
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.331
it will need a little bit of help
from a knife to cut the fascia that

13
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.800
that connects the muscles together.

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.337
So once I start scoring that fascia
you can see I can literally just pull.

15
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.472
That's sirloin tip away.

16
00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.476
The next one we're going to take off
is my insdie round, and I'm looking for

17
00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.946
between the inside round
and this eye of round here, so.

18
00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:51.818
There's a confusing little muscle here
that sits on the lower

19
00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.953
side of the inside round right here,
you can see

20
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.555
you can actually follow that seam
if you want it.

21
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.656
That's not really the one we want.

22
00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.492
We want to actually identify
where that eye of round is.

23
00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.960
And that's this muscle right here.

24
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.164
So we're just going to use our knife again
to go in between the muscles.

25
00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.101
And once I find the separation

26
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.405
I can then pull out all three muscles.

27
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.608
And again, our inside
round, our gooseneck and our sirloin tip.
