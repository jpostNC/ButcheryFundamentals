00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.137
So this is the picnic section,
and I'm going to just start removing

2
00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.507
certain items, but these certain items
might be items that aren't

3
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.543
necessarily familiar
to the general public,

4
00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.647
but I think they have great
cooking applications and are very useful.

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.784
So the first ones we're going to remove
is what's known as the country ribs

6
00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.819
or in translation to beef.

7
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.622
This would be your chuck short ribs,
so they're great.

8
00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.258
They're actually quite meaty
and you'll see them, so I take them off.

9
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.561
So once I identify
where the very first rib is here,

10
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:33.233
when we were counting in our four ribs,
I can use that to just follow

11
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.837
along the side and then what
I want to find is the seam or that fascia

12
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.108
that connects these this muscle structure
to the ones underneath of it.

13
00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.411
So I can now just seam this out.

14
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.713
And you can almost start
just pulling these away

15
00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.816
while using a little bit of

16
00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.653
strength to pull and cut the fascia.

17
00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.223
So once I get those removed now,

18
00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.994
I've got what's called my country ribs.

19
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.564
And if there's any of this white bone
or cartilage to be removed, we're good.

20
00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.565
We take that away.

21
00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.734
And now I've got these country ribs.

22
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.405
My brisket section is in here, so I'm
looking specifically in this section here.

23
00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.911
And once I find it again, you can almost
start to pull a lot of these muscles away.

24
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.747
So I'm going to use my knife to come in

25
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.451
and remove this brisket

26
00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.053
like so

27
00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:29.889
and I come just around

28
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.993
where the humerus bone is.

29
00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.496
I'm just going to cut it down.

30
00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.599
So here's our pork

31
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.969
brisket just needs a little bit of TLC
to get it to something

32
00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.140
recognizable and usable, which means that
I'm just going to remove this skin. Skin

33
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.382
is away,

34
00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:00.153
and then I can start removing
any unnecessary muscles.

35
00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:03.590
This is in the shoulders so notoriously
going to have not only veins,

36
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.460
but glands in there as well too, well,
just to remove some of the surface fat.

37
00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.631
Get this out of the way.

38
00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.867
So over.

39
00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:17.537
We're good, there's our Pork brisket.
