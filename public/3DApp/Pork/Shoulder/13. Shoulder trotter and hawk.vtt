00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:04.070
We're looking
at the front shoulder of the animal,

2
00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.039
and we're going to start dissecting

3
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.308
and breaking it down,
but the first thing we'd like to do

4
00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.810
is we start
by taking off the front trotter

5
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.113
and then we'll work
on taking off the front hawk

6
00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.615
before we even
get into the shoulder itself.

7
00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.352
So I like to joint out the front trotter,

8
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.055
and in order to do that,
I need to find where I'm going

9
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.624
to be sinking my knife into
because there is a complicated

10
00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.960
kind of network of bones
and ligaments in here.

11
00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:33.033
So I'm looking for if this would be
the wrist section just above the wrist.

12
00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.537
There's almost like a little nub in here,
so I'm looking for that nub.

13
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.775
Very technical terms here and where
I can sink my thumb just above it.

14
00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.310
That's going to be my marker
to where I want to take it off.

15
00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.181
So I'll start by taking my knife
and holding it in the traditional way.

16
00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.684
I just want to come at that spot like so

17
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.021
and what I'm doing is
as I'm rounding my knife into it

18
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.792
because there's a thick tendon
that sits almost in a concave bone.

19
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.695
So I'm going to take my knife
and come into that section there.

20
00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:04.364
And once I've

21
00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.667
exposed it, that allows me
to put a little bit of down pressure on it

22
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.370
and then I can actually just run
my knife in like so

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.473
and I can joint out

24
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.510
that front I can, as you can see,
a complicated network of bones in here

25
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.747
and that thick tendon
just sits right in this area here.

26
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.683
So there's our front trotter.

27
00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:28.721
I could joint out the hawk here,
but for I think culinary purposes,

28
00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.192
instead of having the natural shape
come out

29
00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:35.829
because it almost comes down into a deep
v, which creates kind of a weird,

30
00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.499
I don't know, un, unsymmetrical shape.

31
00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.603
So I like to come in and make it just one
clean cut across.

32
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.873
So I'm using as a marker this section
right here, which would be for

33
00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.310
lack of a better term, an elbow
and into the armpit.

34
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.212
So elbow to armpit,

35
00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.081
I'm going to take my steak knife
and I'm just going to come in and cut.

36
00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.053
So and then I'll take my hand saw.

37
00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:04.924
I'll just cut through the bone

38
00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.894
and then finish off my cut.

39
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.965
Like so.

40
00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:16.536
Then you can see where the front hawk.

41
00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.604
And there is the trotter.
