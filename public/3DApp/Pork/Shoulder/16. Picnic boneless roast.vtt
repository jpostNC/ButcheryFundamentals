1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.768
So we remove the brisket.

2
00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.436
Now I want to start boning it out,

3
00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.572
but before I bone it out,
I actually want to skin it

4
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.042
so much like what we did with the ham,
if you saw that video.

5
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.176
Same principle applies.

6
00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.579
We're just going to make
a couple of passes underneath the skin.

7
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.349
I don't really need my hand
near the process until I can take

8
00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.650
some slack off of it.

9
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.255
And again, I want to keep as much fat
on the shoulder as possible,

10
00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.358
so I'm going to be coming in
and making these nice, long,

11
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.595
fluid passes again.

12
00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.908
Make sure we're removing all the skin,

13
00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:44.044
and now we're going to bone it out,
so we do have

14
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.714
just where the separation
is of the scapula and the humerus.

15
00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:52.685
What I want to do
is look for the seam in the muscles

16
00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.890
that aligns with humerus bone
here, and it's this seam right here.

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.224
So what I like to do is

18
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.495
I'm going
to come in on the right side of it

19
00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.965
and I'm removing this muscle
in particular here

20
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:10.570
that sits cradled right
beside this muscle here,

21
00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.606
if we were talking about beef
that would be called the boulder blade,

22
00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:18.111
that's a cut in the UK, but it's on pork,
so we won't worry about it so much.

23
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.181
And then I'm going to
come on the other side

24
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.983
and I'm just opening up that meat around

25
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.853
that humerus.

26
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.989
And whatever's left of the shoulder
blade that we went through,

27
00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.993
so I'm just opening it up.

28
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.431
I'm coming around the bone like so.

29
00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.405
I'll switch my grip

30
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.341
to whatever feels most comfortable
in order to get these bones out,

31
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.443
and then I want to go back over
and make sure that I'm not leaving

32
00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.414
too much meat on those bones either,
although they will make great stock.

33
00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.451
So that's good.

34
00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.089
So now we've got a boneless picnic roast,
and now I need to kind of go over it

35
00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.725
and make sure that there's no veins
or any glands in there.

36
00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.828
So this can be either left as is

37
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.031
or trussed up like So

38
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.102
and we can either apply a dry roast
or a slow cook to it.

39
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.905
Shred it. We can get some nice
pull pork out of that as well to.
