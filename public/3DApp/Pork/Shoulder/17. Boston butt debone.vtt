00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.436
We've got our Boston section
now, we've already dealt with the picnic.

2
00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.774
What we're going to do now
is we're going to skin it and bone it.

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.677
So first thing I want to do is again,
I want to skin it.

4
00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.280
So this is some really nice back
fat on here.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.851
So I absolutely want to leave as much of
that on the shoulder as possible.

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.653
So we'll just go ahead and skin it.

7
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.697
And I want to keep the skin

8
00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.733
tight as I'm pulling away from it,
you'll notice

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.670
my fingers really aren't behind the skin
where the blade is cutting.

10
00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.541
For the reason that I don't want that

11
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.144
sharp knife to go through the skin,

12
00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.679
so with this meat
removed from the backbone, now

13
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.483
I'm going to take my knife and I'm going
to come underneath these bones right here

14
00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:52.552
just to

15
00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.221
remove them like so from the equation.

16
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.856
So they're freed up

17
00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:00.293
from the neck bone here because we want
this whole bone structure to come out.

18
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.764
So where I took the country ribs, I'm
now going to come under them here.

19
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.635
Now I can really start to start

20
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.971
working this.

21
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.607
Remove

22
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.278
with minimal damage as possible,
so we've got our

23
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.548
our neck bone
and our backbone coming out as one piece.

24
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.884
OK, so now we're at a state

25
00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.854
where we can get the coppa out,

26
00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.391
which is this main muscle here.

27
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.395
To start seaming it out again
when I say seaming it out, it's

28
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:38.298
like the other principles that we've used
when breaking down the hog.

29
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.367
We're just looking for that fascia
that connects the two muscles

30
00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.069
or the muscle groups.

31
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.407
So I'll just start by nicking the fascia
in order to remove it the.

32
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.144
Scapula is a flat bone,
so I'm going to just be using my knife

33
00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.847
to stay flat on the bone, to remove it.

34
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.318
I get past the scapula
where I cut it right down. OK,

35
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.988
so now what I've got

36
00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:04.958
is my main muscle coppa.

37
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.060
To finish it off,

38
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.062
I've got the scapula that needs to come

39
00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:12.632
out of this section here,
so I'm going to use that seam here

40
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.602
just to kind of almost trace
around the exterior.

41
00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.771
And then as we spoke about before,
the scapula is a flat bone.

42
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.973
So I'm just going to come and use my knife

43
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.509
to get the meat off
of the top of that scapula.

44
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.311
So just removing it all.

45
00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.348
And now I'm

46
00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:31.684
going to actually come under the scapula
to remove the bone.

47
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.623
So in order to do that, I will manipulate
it just up on its side, like so

48
00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:41.528
and I'm going to come in under it.

49
00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.031
Like so.

50
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.535
And just start working it out.

51
00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.940
Like so

52
00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.243
now the

53
00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:00.747
shoulder blade has been removed
and we've got a boneless piece.
