1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:04.004
So after the trotter and the hawk
have been removed, now we have our square

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.041
cut shoulder that gets split
into two different sections,

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.378
we've got our Boston butt
and our picnic sections here.

4
00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.081
I like to actually bone out
the picnic section

5
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.485
with these
what's called country ribs intact.

6
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.421
So I'm going to go ahead
and just use my saw to cut through there.

7
00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.358
So I'll come in with the saw
and I'm just using

8
00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.428
the base of the neck bone in here
as my guiding.

9
00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.531
OK, my guidelines,
so I'm just going to come through

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.334
and cut through those first four ribs
that we were looking for

11
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.670
that were used as markers
to separate the shoulder from the loin.

12
00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.108
So once I'm through the ribs on set,
I'll take my steak knife.

13
00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.444
It comes and I'm just cutting

14
00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:48.548
down into the bone and what we're hitting
there is the scapula.

15
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.052
So once we identify where the scapula is
with the knife, we'll come back in

16
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.521
and just finish off the cut
with the hand saw.

17
00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.894
And once I'm through,

18
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.930
I'll come back in again

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.733
and cut the skin away.

20
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.836
And now I've got my

21
00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.871
Picnic section.

22
00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:13.973
And my Boston bad section.
