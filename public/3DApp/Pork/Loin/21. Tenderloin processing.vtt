00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.036
We've got the pork tenderloin here,
which is the most tender muscle

2
00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:06.373
on the whole body,
and we just need to get it to a state

3
00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:10.276
where it is
not inhibited by silver skin anymore.

4
00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.512
So we're going to be denuding
the tenderloin.

5
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.381
A few things
that we're going to talk about

6
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.883
first,
though, is we have a lot of this exterior

7
00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:19.953
almost loose fat on here
and we do see some more glands in here

8
00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:20.787
and some more veins.

9
00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.456
So we need to be cognizant of that
and just make sure we're removing them.

10
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.327
This section here also has
what's called the chain, which is a side

11
00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:32.665
muscle that we can pretty much
just take our fingers

12
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.534
and remove it.

13
00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:36.836
Right.

14
00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.405
There's our chain

15
00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.174
and what we want to do with
the chain is just remove any of that.

16
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.210
Heavy glands

17
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.546
and fat on it that can be used for trim.

18
00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.783
So now the tenderloin, like I don't like

19
00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.385
to use the knife very much
when I'm working with the Tenderloin,

20
00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.422
you're apt to get in there and maybe,

21
00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.424
you know, make nicks in areas
that you don't want.

22
00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.327
So I'll use my fingers to actually work
a lot of this stuff out.

23
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:05.198
So once I can find an area
where I can get my fingers in.

24
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.301
I'll come in and I'll actually just

25
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.204
start pulling away a lot of this fat

26
00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.274
to get it to where I want it to be.

27
00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.177
So a lot of this fat is just removable
with your fingers.

28
00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.313
And then once we get it to that state
where it's holding on a little bit

29
00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.850
tighter, that's when I'll take my knife and just start removing some of this stuff.

30
00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.487
So we're going to remove this fat.

31
00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.792
And then what we're left with is our
tenderloin with this silver skin on it.

32
00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.894
So we do want to remove the silver skin,

33
00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.331
and we can certainly do a few different
applications for the tenderloin.

34
00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.467
It can be either cut into medallions.

35
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.502
We could trust it in roasted whole,

36
00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.605
butterfly it opened, stuff
it, all sorts of possibilities,

37
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.975
but I find that coming underneath

38
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.011
and just denuding the tenderloin like so.

39
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.352
Removing any of that silver skin.

40
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.356
Getting it to this point here

41
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.425
and now we've got a tenderloin

42
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.260
totally denuded.

43
00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:09.562
Ready for use.
