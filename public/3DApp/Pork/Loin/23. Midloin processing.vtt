1
00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.535
So where
the tenderloin was kind of cradled on top.

2
00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.672
I do have a bit of a muscle that's left,

3
00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.641
so I'll just run my knife
along that section.

4
00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.278
And just remove.

5
00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.582
So once I get that piece of meat
out of there, which can go into trim,

6
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.085
I now have a better line of sight at these
what we call feather bones.

7
00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.222
So I start by coming underneath
the feather bones

8
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:27.127
and I can do them one by one,
or I can come in and do them all at once.

9
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.563
Depending on your comfort level,

10
00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.901
and then I need to focus on
getting this backbone removed, too,

11
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.871
so I'll come in on this side,
I'll switch my grip.

12
00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.509
And I'll, just kind of follow
along that backbone, like so

13
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:46.179
so now these bones are released
and these bones are released.

14
00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.984
I just need to kind of work out that bone.

15
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:55.722
So using the tip of my

16
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.291
life, I'm
just kind of working in and out along

17
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.228
what's known as pin bones in here.

18
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.665
So we'll just cut to the section
where we can get those pin bones out.

19
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.268
And now I've got a boneless loin, OK,

20
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.272
from the boneless loin section. Um,

21
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:17.911
I like to get boneless loin chops,
but we can also put it in a cure

22
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.214
and we would get our peameal bacon
out of this.

23
00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:25.218
So what we'll look at is first getting
a nice boneless loin chop out of it.

24
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.022
And again, most kind of like dealer's
choice, how thick you want to cut them

25
00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:33.493
fast fry would be something thinner
in this neighborhood.

26
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.197
We took off

27
00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.799
fat, be something more of a fast fry.

28
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:44.070
And then for those more adventurous cooks,
you can go a little bit thicker

29
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.271
as a boneless loin chop

30
00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.107
and just come

31
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.710
underneath of it
and take the skin off like so.

32
00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.814
And then we also have if we flip it over

33
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.751
and take off the skin.

34
00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.452
Like so.

35
00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.988
Like I did with the sirloin.

36
00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.023
Something that.

37
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:08.962
Might be a little bit more common might be
a butterfly chop that we've seen before.

38
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.231
So I can come in.

39
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.268
Cut it, not all the way down to the table,

40
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.370
but almost

41
00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.040
all the way from that side.

42
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.777
You have got a butterfly chop as well.
