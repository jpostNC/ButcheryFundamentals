00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.437
So we've
got our pork loin, and this is what

2
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.174
generally fetches the highest retail value

3
00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.911
generally because of its tenderness and,

4
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.482
well, marketability, it's
this is where we get all of our pork

5
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.752
chops from and we get our tenderloin
and we get our sirloin, et cetera.

6
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.654
So we're going to go ahead
and just start taking it apart

7
00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.822
into its different sections.

8
00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.858
And the first muscle
that I want to pull off

9
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.927
is the tenderloin,
which is this muscle that sits right here.

10
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.365
OK, so the tenderloin
is actually cylindrical in shape,

11
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.204
and it's cradled in on this bone
underneath of it, so we just normally need

12
00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:42.442
to find where the tail of the tenderloin
is or where it meets up with the rack.

13
00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.111
And then what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to run my knife along

14
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.312
that backbone.

15
00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.316
And then at a certain

16
00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.853
point, once I've come all the way down
to the bone where it's cradle, then

17
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.190
I can start using it, my fingers
to work it away

18
00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:02.195
to minimize the amount of knife work
that I need to do that allows me to.

19
00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.265
Pretty much pull it right out.

20
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.968
So once we get it to this stage,
I'm just going to come with my knife

21
00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.738
on the tip of my knife
on the other side of it.

22
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.677
And there is our tenderloin.

23
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.081
So I'm actually going to start
by taking the sirloin off,

24
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.982
and where do I want to take up
the sirloin?

25
00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:27.287
I'm looking for the discs in the spine
as my markers.

26
00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.256
So where the tailbone meets up
with the backbone,

27
00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.392
there's going to be a disc right here.

28
00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.526
That's not the one I want.

29
00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:36.396
I want the one in towards the rack.

30
00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.765
So I'm going to use my steak knife.

31
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.167
I'm going to go
right into the disc itself,

32
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.537
right, and then I'm going to bring it down

33
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:46.639
like so.

34
00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.909
So once I've gone through that disc
and made my knife cut,

35
00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.912
we take the saw
and just go through the vertebrae here.

36
00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.149
Sorry, the disc into that section

37
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.785
just a few passes
until I'm done coming to the bone.

38
00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:02.122
Then I'll go through with my steak

39
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.158
knife
and I'm just going to finish off that cut.

40
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.960
Now I've removed my sirloin section.

41
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.630
OK, the next part I'm going to take off
is the rack,

42
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.066
so I'm looking for my very last rib.

43
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.668
So that's the one I'm going to be using.

44
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.103
So again, same technique.

45
00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.873
I'm just going to come into this section
here and make a cut down,

46
00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:25.078
take my saw through a couple of passes.

47
00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.249
Now I can come through
and cut this section off.

48
00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.950
There is going to be a rib here.

49
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.621
So a little trick that I like to use
is, I'll actually free that rib

50
00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.289
with my boning knife.

51
00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:41.394
So it's a little bit more flexible now
I can come through and cut that loin out.

52
00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.364
So now I've got my three sections.

53
00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.200
I've got my rack,
my midloin and my sirloin.
