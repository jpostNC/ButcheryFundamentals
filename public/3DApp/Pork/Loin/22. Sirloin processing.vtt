1
00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.036
So we've got our top sirloin section.

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.774
And if we were talking about beef,
we have way more opportunities

3
00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.243
to merchandise a lot of the muscles
that would be in the top sirloin.

4
00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.847
But because pork is smaller,
we just don't have the same opportunities.

5
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.782
But it's I think it's worth mentioning
that out of the top throw.

6
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.185
And this is also where you would get
your tri tip and your Percona out of here.

7
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.887
And we can certainly look at those muscles
in here.

8
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.456
But again,
the merchandizing opportunities for pork

9
00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.492
just aren't there
the same way they are for beef.

10
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.561
So in our top sirloin,
what I like to do is bone it out

11
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.397
and then we can either use it as a roast
or chop.

12
00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.333
So first thing's first, though,
I do like to skin it.

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.036
And because it is a pretty square
cut in fairly stable,

14
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.004
I can always stand it up on its end
like so

15
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.441
and that I can just start
removing the skin without worrying about

16
00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.079
getting a lot of that back fat out
so I can just make my long fluid passes.

17
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.481
Like so

18
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.251
making sure I'm following the shape
of the sirloin

19
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.218
itself.

20
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.261
Skin off,
and then I'm just going to worry about

21
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.265
or sorry, work on getting this kind of hip
bone out with the tailbone here.

22
00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.200
There's a muscle right here
that I'd like to remove,

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.136
which would be an extension
of that spider steak or that oyster steak.

24
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.439
So that comes out.

25
00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.075
And now I can just start working on
getting

26
00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.745
those two bones out together.

27
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.881
So I'll come underneath right here
where it's flat

28
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.152
and just going to pull my knife down
and under

29
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.688
and then remove it.

30
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.460
Like so right,
so then my bone has been removed.

31
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.129
I'm just really going
to be squaring it off, so

32
00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.832
this would be the section
where we would find our tri tip

33
00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.834
when I find that seam there.

34
00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.269
I'll just come down.

35
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.572
We were talking about beef again,
that tri tip would be under there

36
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.876
from this section,
I just want to have really squared off.

37
00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.945
This would be the work
from where the tailbone came off.

38
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.047
So I'm just going to square that like so.

39
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.817
And now
after we square it up on the bottom,

40
00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:02.322
we've got a nice opportunity
for a boneless sirloin roast like so

41
00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.192
but I think it's worth
looking at sirloin chops.

42
00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.063
So for me, dictating
however thick you want them to be.

43
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.867
I think this one is well
and deserving of three chops, so

44
00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.904
we'll get three
nice sirloin chops out of this.
