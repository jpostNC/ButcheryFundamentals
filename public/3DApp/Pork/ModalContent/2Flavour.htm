<p>Pork flavour varies within different breeds and also on what they eat. <br> 
    In fatty breeds like Berkshire and Red Wattle, the flavour ranges from buttery and creamy to earthy and vegetal. <br>
    Lean breeds like Duroc and Tamworth, have clean and mild flavour which is slightly sweet. (Lee, 2014) <br>
</p>

<p>In commodity pork, where pigs are raised more for meat rather than fat content, the flavour is mild and neutral, which makes it ideal meat for incorporating additional flavours of spices and marinades.</p>
