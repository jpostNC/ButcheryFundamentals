<p>Whole carcasses of pork can be held at 0-2℃ with good air circulation for upwards of 10 days, depending on the amount of fat cover. Pork cannot be held in raw state for as long as lamb and beef. Beef can age for months, while pork will go rancid after 10 days.

<p>Freshly ground pork can be held at 0-2 ℃ (32-35 ℉) for 48 hours.
</p>

<p>Roasts and steaks can be held at 0-2 ℃ (32-35 ℉) for 5 - 7 days.

<p>The best practice for all proteins is to vacuum seal them.  This takes up the least amount of space and can prevent cross contamination. Vacuum sealing also limits the exposure to moisture and air, which will delay bacterial growth. </p>
