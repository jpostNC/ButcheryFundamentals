<p>The pig in the video is not representative of commercial pork for sale in most butcher shops or grocery stores in Canada. Pigs are raised in large farms  and most are raised indoors. There are 21 million pigs in Canada. For more info see Ontario Pork in the Further Learning section. </p>

<p>Pork can be purchased and cooked whole, or cut down into primal and fabricated cuts.
    Many parts of pig production are also used to produce Insulin, heart valves, suede, clothing, gelatin and pet treats.
