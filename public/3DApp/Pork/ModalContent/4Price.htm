<p>Pork is one of the more affordable meats in the market. Comparatively, commodity pigs are cheaper than beef and lamb. However, heritage breeds of pork can cost up to four times the price of commodity pigs. The increased cost is due to: the breed, feed, environment and labour-intensive process of raising pigs in their natural life cycle.  For a Tamworth pig the  whole animal costs $9.99/lb ($22/kg).  Commodity pork costs between $1.99-2.99 for a whole animal.
